,summarization
0,The hotel is heavily used by and geared to tour groups. There are a lot of arrivals and departures in the night and early morning. The food was good and the service very friendly and welcoming.
1,"The Ashok is reasonably close to the airport. Getting there is rather odd, you have to drive down a dirt track. Service in the restaurant was OK, as was the food."
2,useful stopover if visiting Delhi. good pool and excellent food. road works when i was there so getting to and from was a bit of a problem. taxi ride away from nightlife in delhi.
3,On a five star scale rating this hotel would qualify as a high end 3 star hotel. It's an older resort style hotel but has few amenities. We stayed in a room facing away from the street and did not have any complaints about the noise.
4,"The hotel is located near both the domestic and international airport. While the rate on the asiarooms website was fantastic, guests should be warned that this hotel charges astronomical rates for its taxi service. Food and drinks are also very expensive here."
5,The hotel was our first and last nights in India. There was no queue at check in and our room was super. The gift shop was small but pleasant (although they tried to sell us an elephant with its tusks missing)
6,"Really a good hotel. Food, services room ambience everthing was really great. Not very close to town but good place to stay."
7,"Hotel is overpriced and its directorial policy - greedy. Rates changed when we were there, but they still charged us for the higher rate quoted in our e-mails. Not once were we offered as much as a complimentary glass of water."
8,"The Ashok Country Resort is in Rajasthan, Agra and Delhi. Given the relatively high rates, I'd rate the resort as below average at best."
9,"The Ashok is basically a transit hotel used by holiday companies. It is set in tidy and secure grounds, a short ride from the airport. During my stay, I found the hotel staff to be polite and helpful."
10,"Ashok Country Resort promises more than the hotel can provide. The garden is very nice, but it isn't calm because of the traffic outside. The food in the restaurant is everage, the breakfast small."
11,Stayed 1 night at the beginning of the Kuoni Taj Tour. Was nice and close to the airport so the trip to and from was very easy. Rooms on the ground floor are not as nice as the rooms on the 2nd floor.
12,i was supposed to stay for 4 nights but ran after 3 could not take it anymore. The worst rooms i have ever stayed in. The only thing good was some of the foods served in the restaurant.
13,"The room was horrible, look 20 years old, not even a proper mattress on the bed, the bed sheets and towels were 10 years old...We ordered some room service at 01:30 am, big mistake, it took 1 hour for a club sandwich to arrive and it look like they went to buy it in a small food stall on the road side. When we checked out we where not asked how was our stay or gave any comment card or else, meaning that they don't care what you think."
14,"Great hotel, very close to Delhi International airport, ideal for a 1 night stay before an early flight. Large pool area is relaxing, and they served a good and varied snack menu since we didn't want to wait until the main restaurant opened at 7pm."
15,We stayed at the Ashok as part of a tour and found it to be a good hotel. Not as posh as some of the Hotels in town but we found this place ok.
16,"We booked our stay for only one night in this hotel. We reserved a pick up service and upon arrival at the airport, we didn't see any one so we called at the hotel. The hotel looks quite old and the room we got was not very clean."
17,Hotel in Inida is a good place to stay if you're flying the next day or wish to get away from the crowds. The well manicured gardens and the relaxed bar and restaurant were just what we needed.
18,Staff friendly but we encoutered a problem when they tried to charge us for our transfer to the airport which was sorted through kuoni!!!!but you expect these tryu ons in India.
19,We booked this hotel as it was near the airport and was supposedly a very high standard. They then charged the full amount of our stay on our credit card - very suspicious. There was no hot water in the room - asked at reception - told to wait a bit an it would be fixed. It then took me 30 minutes of very vocal complaining in reception to get my money back.
20,"The pool was nice and the grounds were really well kept. Due to the location the hotel is the main option for food, unless you get a taxi. The food here was good."
21,Hotel was convenient for the airport but a long taxi ride from downtown Dehli. The rooms were clean and comfortable although some of our group reported that their room smelt musty. The buffet breakfast had a mix of Western and Indian food and was satisfactory.
22,"The Ashok is at the beginning and end of the Kuoni &quot;Taj Tour. It was convenient for the airport but a longish taxi ride from downtown Dehli. The rooms were pleasantly decorated, clean and comfortable."
23,Not bad as a transit hotel for 1 night but wouldn't stay any longer than that. Decent size though aircon pretty forlorn and controls didn't seem to work. Free safety deposit box on reception.
24,"This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The bathroom had a strong smell of urine, the room smelled of mold and the air conditioner made the smell even worse. The mattress was about 2&quot; thick. I have had more comfort camping in a sleeping bag."
25,The positives were the food in the restaurant (quite good) and the pretty grounds. The negatives were the room and the dust inside. The public computer in the foyer was filthy with grime and dust.
26,This was the nicest of the 4 hotels we stayed in on our tour of India. It had a lovely pool area and a nice restaurant. Owner of the hotel was in attendance and keen to speak to all the guests.
27,"Hotel is a very nice hotel the rooms are clean and large it was cold so the staff put heaters in the rooms, the bathroom was a little old but clean all the same. The only problem was that they only put the hot water on at certain times of the day so its either cold or tepid showers overall a nice place."
28,"Stayed here on our first night in India on Voyages Jules Verne Golden Triangle tour. Hotel chosen, I suspect, because of its proximity to the airport. Breakfast had an interesting variety of foods."
29,"I stayed there because It was near the aiport where I arrived at midnight and had a flight leaving next day at eight. My flight was delayed, ended up staying for 3 hours. Its located near the highway and even in the middle of the night the noice was dusturbing."
30,"We had a very brief stay at the hotel, but it was fine. The long problem we had was the car they sent to the airport to pick us up was designed for two people and little luggage. There were four of us and a lot of luggage!"
31,The Ashok Country Resort in Inida was by far the worst place we stayed in. The service from the reception was nothing short of rude. The prices for drinks and food within the hotel were 5 star hotel prices.
32,"We used the Ashok for a first night in India and were very satisfied. The pickup from the airport worked well and the hotel was comfortable and clean. It is not a 5*, but then you are not paying 5* prices."
33,"3 am is not a good time to arrive anywhere, for sure not India. The rooms are big, clean and fairly comfortable. Feeding arrangements are good, but beware hordes of French groups on tour."
34,"Privately owned and operated, this full service hotel is located between city and airport. Owner's son sits on a desk in the lobby and is very accommodating, as is the staff. Two European tour groups partied boisterously in two rooms with doors open near us until way past midnight."
35,"Hotel is in a quiet location near the airport,rooms are big and comfortable,staff are polite and nvery helpful. Swimming pool is clean and big in size,gardens are well kept."
36,"We stayed here two nights in late March 2007. Breakfast buffet was good, and lunch was excellent in the resort’s restaurant. The well-maintained grounds, with lots of flowers, a pool, and benches, gave us the breathing space we needed."
37,Stunning gardens with a clean pool &amp; loud peacock. I found the Reception staff to be aloof and not very welcoming esp. on the first night of our tour.
38,"Stayed here on 1st and 7th day of the Kuoni Taj Tour. It's mainly clean, everything worked in the bedroom, although we had a very noisy fridge !! The bar area is very small and there is not much of a sitting area."
39,"When we arrived in Dehli we went straight to the hotel. The room was cold and the bed damp, we had to request an additional heater in our room. Breakfast the following morning was okay. This is an average tourist hotel."
40,"The rooms were clean and quiet, bathroom clean and adequate. Good varied buffet breakfast. Lovely gardens, and the pool looked nice, though it was too cool to try it in December."
41,"The rooms are nice, the bathroom a little old. The restaurant indeed advised to take the buffet at 563 rupees each. We didn't have breakfast, as our planes left very early."
42,The Ashok Country Resort is located in the Golden Triangle. The hotel is very isolated and there is absolutely NOTHING in the vicinity. The only good thing about it is the proximity to the airport.
43,"This was the most disappointing hotel we stayed in in India. The room was not cleaned properly, smelt a bit damp and there was no hairdryer in the room. Only redeeming features were friendly staff and nice grounds."
44,"Room was lovely, with a large screen plasma! Very clean. Far too expensive for what it was (I paid £76) The grounds are very nice but the buffet restuarant is terrible."
45,The rooms are modern and beautifully decorated. The pool is large and refreshing in the midst of hot Dehli. There is a nice lounge area open 24 hours if you need some masala chai or a beer late at night. The proximity to the airport makes it an easy place to stay.
46,"The hotel is comfortable near the both airports, nice when you arrive in the middle of the night and need sleep. The first time the breakfast was very poor, because there were hardly any guests. Uncomfortable is, that the bedding is humid."
47,"Stayed here for one night only as it's convenient fot the airport and we were flying home next day. No complaints - helpful staff, comfortable room and good food."
48,Fairly decent 3 star airport hotel. Seemed filled with tour groups. Rooms were good sized but had a distinctly mildew smell you noticed the second inside the door.
49,"Stayed here twice for one night in different rooms during a tour with Kuoni. Overall the hotel is quite acceptable for a short stay, and it's only approx 20 minutes from the airport. The rooms were fairly well appointed for a 'medium' class hotel."
50,I selected this hotel because it was close to the airport and also price point is good. There is no in room internet access. The gym is ok but opens late at 8am only. Not a suitable hotel for long business trips.
51,"I stayed for one day, and was thoroughly disappointed with what I got. The food in the restaurant was tasteless, the refrigerator in the room not working. The surcharge on long distance calls as charged by them could not be justified on any account."
52,"The restaurant was very poor, the carpets were stained, the rooms smelt, the sink was broken, bathroom dirty, the price was expensive compared with other hotels. For a Gov. run hotel, it needs to get its act together."
53,"I was put up here by a Government of India agency I was visiting. The hotel is owned by GOI, and so they get preferential rates. Service was professional but not obsequious, not overly solicitous."
54,"Old glory has gone and it will take a multimillion investment to ever get this back. The state of the hotel is miserable, the only thing that has been restored is the entrance lobby. Free wireless internet was available and it worked well, but every 24 hours you had to return to the reception desk to get a new voucher."
55,"The hotel and particularly the rooms are dirty. The space of the rooms is fine, the furnitures really old (but OK) but you can see everywhere that there is no proper cleaning. In no case this is a 5 stars hotel, but it is not terrible."
56,"The location is quite good almost midway between the city center and the airport. The staff was courteous but a bit lazy, rooms were good but seemed a bit old as far as the upholstery is concerned. The food was average and we preferred eating outside in the private restaurants."
57,"Price is normally around 8k INR which makes it one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest in Delhi. Staff are servile and still retain the sycophantic outlook always on the lookout for tips."
58,"Jet Airways Provided us one night stay at this hotel. As Jet Airways staff didn't board our baggage at origination Point. So,this stay was given by Airlines. But we didn't find this hotel equal to 5 star hotel standards."
59,"As an invited participant of an' International Stakeholders' consultation, I was accommodated in 'The Ashok',Chanakyapuri,New Delhi. An aristocratic name in the diplomatic enclave of the capital city raised our expectations to perhaps somewhat unreasonable limits. There were major problems with the attitude and approach of the staff."
60,The ashoka hotel is one of the grandest hotels in India built by the govrnment. The hotel has exceptional facilties - the gym and swimming pool is very good. The price is very high though for the qulity of service and good.
61,This is a very lousy place with nothing great about it and comes with a very high tariff rates. Everything is very costly and rooms are not well maintained. The only exception is the Restaurant Frontier which serves good food.
62,"I stayed at the Ashok this past week and was quite relieved that it was not as horrible as the other reviews indicate. My room did not seem dirty, and housekeeping came daily - i left a tip each day, so maybe that helped. Housekeeping are big tip seekers....despite leaving a tip when i left in the morning, they would ring my doorbell at 8-9 at night to &quot;see if i needed anything. They hang out in the hallway and pounce when you come back to inform you that they changed the fruit in your room or whatever,. looking for a tip. Also i was supposed to have free breakfast in the coffee shop included in my room tarrif. Most days i didn't bother."
63,"Shabby, smelly , tired, and that was just the staff. Poorly trained they did not have a clue. The fixtures and fittings were poor, the views awful and generally just disappointing. Our 3 1/2 night stay cost £700 - do not stay here."
64,"Was my 4th stay at the hotel since 2000 and sorry to state that it's not getting better. Staying there as it's the place of the conference I am attending so it's just to avoid taking taxis on several occasions per day. Had booked and confirmed room with balcony though received room without. When referring back to the reception's staff, was informed, that the rate is the same."
65,"I and my wife were travelling to Delhi for romantic getaway. We wanted to spend time in some good hotel so we could remember the stay as well as the places of stay. We had heard a lot about Hotel Ashok, how magnificient it is and how marvelous the view from the hotel top looks. When we visited the hotel, we were impressed by how huge it looks from outside and how well it was maintained."
66,"The Ashok is a government owned hotel and hence does not have the massive private investment of the other in the diplomatic enclave. The food in the 'Coffee Shop' is good enough, nothing special and the Paprika Chicken is awful. Stay away from most of the food, check out the 'Fusion' bar, the staff are great and really freindly."
67,"My husband and I went there for a medical convention. The next morning we went to the convention and came to the hotel room late...Surprise! room was smelled up with tobacco! i was angry but my husband told me to keep my cool. the next day, we let the cleaning man tidy up our room, my husband was in the shower and me reading."
68,This place is awful. Our hallway smelled very bad (especially in the mornings). Most of the smell remained in the hall and did not come into our room. Our friends from Kenya were met with unacceptable racism from the hotel's club. Stay somewhere else!
69,"In the 6 weeks and 15 cities I've been to in India, this was the worst of the worst. The staff was the rudest I've encountered anywhere. The room was dirty, the location was far from anything, and it was of course overpriced. I highly recommend against staying here."
70,The windows didn't fit properly so you had the noise and the smell of the traffic. We slept on top of the covers because of the state of the bed linen and would not walk on the carpets in bare feet. As for the bathroom - we washed in the sink rather than use the shower/bath.
71,"The Ashoka Hotel is one of the most reasonably priced 5-star accommodation available as it is still government owned. Though many years old, the hotel has good rooms that are well appointed and reasonably big."
72,"I found that my hair dryer would not work, nor my television, not the desk light nor the floor light, and some of the electrical sockets. The food (which tasted quite good, or at least the indian style food) was very expensive - more than the price for a similar meal back in the U.S. Service was terrible - we waited 15/20 mins for some water to be brought to us. The use of wireless access cost $25 a day. The cost per night for this hotel is outrageous for a Delhi hotel - $250 a day - best go elsewhere."
73,"Our room hadn't been vacuumed in ages, there was hair everywhere and orange pits on the bathroom floor. The elevators shorted out on us a couple of times, and our electronic door-key receiver thing took three or four tries to unlock. The lobby is full of carpet and trinket shops."
74,"Hayes &amp; Jarvis &quot;upgraded to the Ashok from the Oberoi Maidens for the first 3 nights of our India tour. We read the reviews and hoped it would not be as bad as reported, but unfortunately it was. Our rooms were dirty, especially the bathrooms which looked as thougth they had not been cleaned properly for years. The restaurant was OK but a long walk along a miserable corridor from the main part of the hotel."
75,"The Ashok is a tired property with ordinary to below average service. The room is clean, the bed comfortable and the water hot but for USD400 you want a little bang for your buck. The fridge was faulty. TV reception unwatchable despite three visits by repairman."
76,"The lowest point was when the waiter in the lobby lounge wiped the tea cups with his finger. The same waiter also had poured us two cups of tea, then whisked the teapot away to finish the rest of the tea with his colleague. Do not stay there!"
77,I booked for a Superior Room but was given a Standard Room instead. The bathroom has no bathtub so the floor is wet after shower. There is not enough space to place toiletries too.
78,The hotel has a an awesome architecture and presents the atmosphere of the historical New Delhi. The service is friendly and the restaurants are of good quality. The fitness and SPA area is really first class: Latest equipment and qualified trainers. The cleanliness and hygiene however was beyond any acceptable standard.
79,"The Ashok Hotel is an old hotel, but that adds to the charm. The food and drink at the restaurants were great and the pool and spa were beautiful. It was expensive, but a weekend in Delhi to see the Taj Mahal was worth it."
80,"We had a terrible shock at the Ashoka Hotel! When we actually arrived in our room we found that there was a complimentary fruit basket which was mouldy and as old as or maybe older than the hotel. There were fake bottles of water...that were supposed to be mineral water but had been filled up with local tap water. As for the plumbing, the toilets were over flooding and lets just say what went down came straight back up! ....Now for the service...the porters were constantly knocking at the door...waiting for tips and asking silly questions. They also refused to take credit card payments and would only accept cash! The only thing they would keep saying to us is &quot;ma'am!"
81,"Hotel Ashok, 50B Chanakyapuri, is a huge hotel with a number of restaurants and a shopping arcade. It is in New Delhi south of the government area, with no neighborhoodto walk to, and no nearby subway."
82,As a government owned hotel the service is about as bad as it gets. Was probably a great hotel 30 years ago but now rooms are shabby and run down. Do yourself a favour and stay away.
83,"The first night was terrible. The room was muggy, sheets were dirty and the bed was not even flat! The telephone looked like it hadn't been wiped down in 25 years, seriously no joke."
84,"An average 3 star hotel trying to be 5 star. Public areas are ok but the rooms are old, tired and dated. Service is patchy and the facilities are set in something of a time warp. Avoid unless you enjoy wasting money."
85,"This was the worst supposedly 5* hotel we have ever stayed in. The staff were extremely rude, food was awful and the rooms were old and grubby. I would recommend that no one should even consider this hotel."
86,"The hotel is ok if you pay not more than 80 EUR a night for a room. Staff were quite friendly, room service quick, and they have a nice outside pool and spa. But like I said, everything there is just 'alright', which is not good enough for ca. 250 EUR."
87,Hotel Rooms were stinky. It was worst hotel I ever stayed in. I paid 180 $ (INR 8000) for 1 Night. Hotel reception was ok but Rooms are dead.
88,The Ashok is a 5 star deluxe hotel that was built 50 years ago. The lobby is clean but the rooms look dated. Cockroaches were everywhere (and in all 3 rooms that we had)
89,"The Ashok has some great restaurants, an excellent spa, and bags of potential. But the government has got to stop pretending this is a five-star hotel. It's an out-of-the-way, run-down, noisy, unappealing, overpriced wreck of a place."
90,"The Ashok could be a splendid example of traditional Indian grandeur. Sadly, it is not. I checked in late at around 11pm and was greeted by surly receptionists. It took three phone calls and a visit by housekeeping to convince them that I didn't want the room."
91,The rooms are old and run down. There is a stink in the hallway and staff are generally not very helpful. The only good things are the staff in the restaurant and the breakfast buffet. It cost us $220 a night which is a complete rip off.
92,"The Ashok is a tired, grimy, grubby hotel. The rooms are dirty and dated, the service is surly and unatentive. I couldn't beleive this hotel was given a 5-star rating."
93,"I originally was here in the early 80s when it was one of the best hotels in Delhi. With the exception of cable TV, I don't think the rooms have been updated since then. Between the lousy food, the crappy rooms and the creepy guys (security &amp; maids) in the hallways - this is one hotel to avoid."
94,"We where surprised arriving at 5* hotel, where we found grey towels and bed linen. All over the hotel were signs of government ownership - too much of staff, equipment out of order, etc. I expect for that price you can get much better deal."
95,I was staying at the Ashok hotel between the 11th and 16th of May 2006 for business reasons. While moving the hairdryer I received an electric shock. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
96,"The room was very large, the furniture was grubby and tatty. The bathroom smelled, the bath did not drain, the bidet did not work, the W.C. splashed your trousers when flushed. The mini bar was empty. The balcony was very dirty, paint peeling off wood work and no balcony furniture."
97,"Location: In Between Airport, Sites and Central City. Service: Above Average Price: High for location, but worth the rating. Room: Within the rating"
98,"Hotel Ashok is a big hotel in the diplomatic district of new delhi. It has many restaurants and shops and the lobby is Ok, But Ashok hotel was nothing near being five star. I would rather call it something in between one and two star hotel."
99,We stayed at the Ashok for one night in February as our Tour Company (Compass Tours) told us that the Park hotel was not available due to President Bush's visit to India. The management was neither friendly nor helpful. Try to avoid staying here at all cost.
100,"The hotel overall is quite dated but in Delhi is probably quite modern. The restaurants are ok, but I would recommend eating out. There is a health club which is actually not owned by the hotel, it has very good facilities but if you want to use the gym only, they make you use the basic outdoor changing rooms."
101,What a dump. Stay at hotels such as Oberoi which are in a similar price range but deliver first-class amenities and services on all fronts.
102,"Front desk is to small and unorganized to handle more then three guests at a time. Carpeting in hallways is threadbare and dirty. International plug did not work, no internet cable as purported, and remote was non functional."
103,The hotel is in a good location but needs a good clean up. The restaurants had a good service except the chinese restaurant which they warm the food for 2nd time before the serve it. The people in the parking area have to stop shouting through loudspeakers in the middle of the night.
104,The corridors were dark and I came across some dubious looking people during my one day stay there. The bathroom was of 1940's vintage and the toiletry was very cheap. Room service took forever. The thing that rankled me the most was the could not care less attitude of the staff.
105,External appearance is great. The employees dress like professionals. But it is only in their dress and salutations! All employees accept great tips. But service is really poor.
106,The Atrium was definetly an upgrade...but it felt empty. Room was clean but there was a door joining our room with another and we could hear the people next door clearly. The walls are paper thin.
107,"Hotel is 25k from Delhi in another town altogether, Faridabad, an unattractive industrial area. Room was the worst we stayed in throughout our two week stay in India."
108,"I was given a room with a tiny window in a corner, facing out onto an active construction site that was active almost around the clock. Besides the noise, construction workers could look right into the room as soon as a the curtains were open which left me without natural light most of the time. The shower didn't work, and it took them ages to fix, the toilet seat was broken, there was hair on the bedsheets, the carpets in the room were filthy."
109,"The service from check-in to check-out was excellent. All staff were helpful and friendly. Power can be erratic at times, but this is to be expected in Delhi."
110,Fantastically designed hotel with great rooms and good food. Gym and pool is always a nice addition which the avalon certainly does not lack. Only quarm i can think of and that was the shower door not fitting properly leading to a large puddle of water on the bathroom floor. Apart from that... Amazing.
111,"The approach road to Avalon appears unfriendly and dilapidated. The courtyard boasts of a heated indoor pool, but the heating system wasn't functioning during our stay. Breakfast spread is ok."
112,"The Avalon was a pleasure to walk into - bright and spacious reception with modern decor. Lovely double room - almost a suite, very well equipped with TV, sofa, comfy bed with clean and fresh bedding. Staff were friendly and attentive when required.Downside is the location....we booked this through an agent and so did not realise the location otherwise would not have stayed here."
113,The hotel is located in the dry district of Dehli. It is far from the sights and city center so be prepared to pay around 700Rs for 40m or 4 hours and then fees above if doing any sightseeing.
114,"I stayed in one of the Residence suits which was lovely - spacious, well equipped with kitchen, large bathroom, sofa, TV and very comfortable bed. Staff were delightful, really friendly and helpful."
115,This hotel is far from center about 30 mins but it's about 20 mins to airport and about 15 mins to big shopping mall which i am happy over there. shower always leaking out from the shower door and i rang the staff since teh first day but never come to fix it. the room service food is nice there but the breakfast is quite abit limit in choices. the internet is expensive also. it's RS 250 per hour.
116,Restaurant was nice with very pleasant staff. Food was fine if somewhat limited in choice. Swimming Pool (Indoor) was unfortunately so cold we were not brave enough to use it.
117,"This is a very nice, clean well serviced hotel. The gym is great, on staff massages available. The food is fine--and they staff will attempt to make anything for you. the internet is really good, although expensive."
118,"We arrived at the Avalon Courtyard after flying in from Australia. The restaurant served excellent food, only one drawback.....it is a dry hotel, no bar, no liquor served at all and it is in the midle of nowhere."
119,"Very clean, modern and reasonably quiet. Breakfast was served early for us as we were on an early train to Agra. We stayed in a luxury hotel in Agra, which is on the banks of the River Ganges."
120,The Avalon Courtyard is ultra modern and totally lacking in any of the character and charm we experienced during our stays at all the other wonderful heritage hotels and palaces throughout our trip. To say my girlfriend hated it would not be an over statement.
121,"New property that had just opened this month. Rooms are spacious and well suited for a medium term stay. Drawbacks were a challenging location, nothing close by within walking distance so taxis required."
122,"Stayed at this hotel while on holiday in Delhi. Female traveller alone. Rooms are spacious, modern. Service was prompt and the food was good.Pool area is a bit run down and not very well attended."
123,"The Claremont hotel is near the Delhi airport. The hotel allowed for us to have 3 adults and 2 children in one room. The safe in our room was not functioning, so we made certain not leave anything of value in the room."
124,Although it was my cousin marriage arrangement on 09-May-09; Really good stay and dining arrangement with family for couple of days. Hall &amp; Poolside Lawn are perfectly maintain for private function.
125,Hotel is made with class &amp; surrounded with greenary area. Staff was Courteous and well groomed. I really recommend this Hotel.
126,Room are quite spacetous; Coffee Shop Blue Pearl ambience is impressive. Food is wow.. specialy indian &amp; pasta's ; open pool with huge lawn for exercise or move around.
127,"Not a bad hotel. Cox and Kings travel agency used it as an &quot;airport hotel&quot;"" although it's a 25 minute drive from the airport. The rooms are clean and decent, but the &quotshot&quots water was only lukewarm when I took a shower at 3:00am."
128,"On our first day we were welcomed into a severelysmoked out room (we had requested a non-smoking room). We were told we would be transferred. After around fifteen minutes,we contacted the front desk and were told &quot;All rooms sold out!!! We then had to use the lobby facilities all evening."
129,"As we have taken this holiday on weekend &amp; its pakage was great as the hotel was, we were on triple occupancy. Food is equaly good but expensive enough............&amp; as the the hotel clams to be 4star, its fair enough to be.........."
130,A very comfortable and clean hotel in Delhi. The rooms are very spacious and very well maintained. The hotel restaurant is very good and serves Indian and continental food.
131,The conference hall was huge and the staff were cooperative. Overall good for business travellers and tourists travelling alone or couples. May not be attractive or value for money for families.
132,"An over-priced, worthless two night stay. The room was spacious, and relatively clean. The TV was an old piece of junk that made strange crackling and hissing noises. The bathroom looked as if it had not been cleaned since 1982."
133,So clean a hotel. Unbelievable breakfast buffet bar. Clean rooms. On a less crowded road. Entry &amp; Exit very good. Parking OK.
134,i stayed in qutab hotel in march for a day.its purely not a business class hotel.building is old and very average in terms of rooms and services.cleanlyness is ok but not very good.there is a garbage dump near by.
135,"Hotel is in the middle of nowhere surrounded by nothing. Building is old and tired, and so are the rooms. Staff is friendly and professional, but sometimes a bit clumsy. unreliable internet access."
136,"For one night we were without running water (or in lavatory), and often the water ran brown. The quality and upkeep of the food is questionable. At breakfast the sliced tomato/cucumber was dried up and almost curling. poor range of food available for breakfast."
137,"The Qutab is a nice modern 7 storey building. Nice marble entrance, helpful and very friendly staff. Rooms are spacious, some with great flatscreen tv, others with standard equipment. Good beds, minibar, in room safe, okay bathroom (not much water pressure in shower). Cosy bar/breakfast restaurant."
138,"We stayed here for one night at the start of our tour and for 2 nights at the end. The rooms were very clean, modern, quiet &amp; comfortable. The buffet breakfast was excellent."
139,"I stayed at the Qutab twice for a total of six nights in June 2007. Internet worked fine, and 2.5 Euros per hour is not an unusual charge. Food is not bad, and there is an additional, very stylish Indian restaurant in the compound."
140,"Hotel Qutab was a severe disappointment, being nothing better than a standard Holiday inn but at exhorbitant prices. The drawback to this property is that it is not located in the downtown core of Delhi. This property caters to mostly Indian business people and is definately not for a tourist visiting Delhi."
141,"Hotel Qutab is rated a 3-star for class/amenities and a 4-star rating for service. Hotel ratings are too inconsistent in Delhi, and most likely hotel staff in Delhi will tell you what you want to hear."
142,We stayed at the Quatab for 14 days last year and the service especially from the restaurant staff was exeptional. We are trying to book again for 2006.
143,"My family and I stayed at the Qutab on 2 separate occasions in january 2005. On leaving we did not have time to go to the post office and post our holiday postcards - about 20 of them. We left the money for postage with staff in the reception and someone promised to post the cards. 3 months later, nobody has received a postcard."
144,Conclave Comfort is one of the 3 hotels by the same group in the surrounding locality. Ideally situated specially for people travelling towards Okhala.
145,"It is totaly overpriced and pure nightmare. Staff sleeping on the floor and cleaning means spraying insecticides. Warm water tap doesn't work. Lot of parts have never been cleaned. Breakfast room is ridiculous, dishes not clean."
146,"Hotel Conclave Comfort was booked to stay a couple of nights and we only stayed one. The room was rather cramped, pretty dark and the mattress felt like it must have seen one too many guests - definitely in need of replacement. The only bright spot was the internet connection which was very good and although the room service was quite quick and the food reasonably tasty, it was without a doubt way over-priced."
147,Corus is supposed to provide a 3 star experience to a business traveler with limited budget and location (CP) in mind. For the frugal sorts whose budget is below 4K this seems to be the best place available.
148,I stayed in the hotel for two nights and enjoyed my stay. The hotel is very centrally located. I could see entire Connaught Place. alongwith the &quot;Central Park. The Restaurant very well done up.
149,"Corus was the most expensive hotel we stayed at in India and it certainly was not the best. The location was great, right on the center ring of Connaught Place in between Old and New Delhi. The rooms are on the small side but aren't bad."
150,"We had three rooms for our group, two of which were dumps. No windows and no life. One room on the top floor at the front of the building had access to a superb terrace with a gorgeous view of the Connaught Place."
151,"Stayed with family for three nights at the beginning of a 3 week holiday. Dirty, cracked windows gave us our first look outside. Staff was friendly and helpful - a positive!"
152,"Barely better than a backpackers hostel, this hotel was one of the worst I have ever stayed in. Very noisy, rooms offexternal corridor backing onto dirty back streets. No lift, had to lug bags upstairs.Breakfast minimal on patio next to streets."
153,"The Corus was booked by our Indian colleagues and after reading the reviews on here I was a little concerned. However, although there were problems the hotel was reasonable - and much better than I had anticipated. Overall this hotel is fine if you are looking for somewhere just as a base, but I know it is fairly expensive and you could probably get something better for your money."
154,This is a no frill hotel but was clean and adequate for one night. Breakfast was outside in a patio area and was done very nice. There is no elevator in the hotel.
155,"Hotel was reasonable, rooms very small but clean, excellent location right on the inner circle of Connaught Place. Reception staff seemed either exceptionally helpful or surly, no in between."
156,"A friend booked this hotel through a travel agent and when I checked out the hotel on TripAdvisor, the pictures made it look much more promising than it really was. Walking in, I was taken aback by the trash on the stairs. The rooms weren't any better. A green chair had deep undertones of brown because it was so dirty."
157,Horrible experience. The door bell man was caught in the act and I was shocked. The manager from the hotel asked me not to call the police. Do I need to say anything else?
158,"The rooms are small and some bathrooms are better than others. The rate includes breakfast which is just OK, but better than nothing. There is a fairly good japanese restaurant on the first floor of the hotel, with a garden."
159,"This hotel has a great location on connaught circle and the funky asian fusion restaurant with nice garden downstairs. The rooms however are not great. First time we stayed we had a standard room, which could also be called world's smallest room, and the bathroom, barely room to turn around."
160,"The Corus Hotel is located in Connaught Place, New Delhi. Price was Rs 5000...about US$135. Friendly, uniformed staff with excellent English skills and eager to help."
161,The Corus Hotel's location is very good - right in Connaught Place. Our room was small with a lot of ambient noise. The staff was friendly though the front desk was understaffed.
162,"The hotel is located inside the Bonsai restaurant. The reception area is small like a corridor, but adequate, nothing grand. We stayed at the hotel on two occasions over three weeks as the hotel was booked by the tour guide."
163,"I stayed in this hotel on October 2007 for 4 nights. If you spend most of your time in the hotel to meet some friends or colleagues, I don't recommend it. There is hot water but you need to wait for few minutes to get it as they most probably use solar panels during the day and central heating system at nights."
164,I picked the Corus after reading the latest review in Lonely Planet. Don't make the same mistake. This hotel was totally over-priced for the quality of the experience. For this price you can find a much better place in Delhi.
165,Hotel has a very good location. Reception area is nice. Room was in the main block and had no windows. Air con &amp; fan worked really well.
166,"The hotel is ok, the bed is clean but the bathroom is awful! no hot water! no comfort at all and found many big insects at the shower. The breakfast buffet is good, and the restaurant staff very kind. However the front desk staff was almost rude and unprofessional."
167,"great place, good service, excellent oriental cusine at the restaurant called Bonsai. overall a very comfortable stay. keep it up !"
168,"Price: Excellent $90Location: Excellent - CentralService: Hospitality Redefined - Pleasantly Surprised - New Hotel, Great ServiceRooms: Small - But Reasonable - Neat, Clean and comfortable."
169,"We stayed here for 3 nights after arriving in India for a 3 week tour. Room was large but with grubby sheets,tepid water and the special bonus of blood stained towels."
170,"Dirty, old sheets (one covered in blood, which was not removed after 3 requests), cold showers (was told to run the water for upwards of 5 mins - but even longer running time led to no more than strictly lukewarm), no restaurant / eating room. No toilet paper, only Pepsi in the room bar, no offstreet parking, no formal hotel entrance, but instead a flight of steps up from street level, a street covered in dust."
171,"Cottage Yes Please has started charging on the Wi-Fi use, 100 rupees per day. Double room price at 900, and although the rooms are reasonably clean, most are nothing like the photos on their web site."
172,Hotels in the pahar ganj area offer free luggage storage and airport pick up and drop off. They also offer city tour by a private taxi so you wont have to ask for more.
173,"Cottage Yes Please has friendly and helpful staff and a nice guy that says ""Namaste"" to you when you come and go out the front door. The only downside is that they no longer have free wifi -- it costs 100 rupees per day now."
174,"After having checked many hotels in Paharganj;I chose this one because I needed a WiFi connection. When you arrive at the reception, heavily loaded and tired, you are requested to show your passport. Then, they demand you pay in advance - even if you are out of local currency and you have stacks of dollars to show them."
175,Stayed here for 3 nights+ OK staff+ Good location for travelers+ Room service+ Good rooms- no hot water in the room- driver we organized to the airport through them kept falling asleep at the wheel (not technically their fault)
176,"The hotel is one street over from the Main Bazaar road in an area called Pahar Ganj. On the plus side, the Bazaar is teeming with activity and there are endless shops. The downside of the area is that it's rather grimy and crowded."
177,The hotel is on a side street off the main Pahar Ganj bazaar. It's the filthiest neighborhood I've ever stayed in. For 800 rupees a night -- about $17 US -- we got a clean and comfortable place to stay.
178,"Good hotel considering the price and location. Reasonably clean, though there seemed to be a small colony of cockroaches residing under the fridge."
179,Hotel in Pahar Ganj was a good choice for our first night in Delhi. It was clean and the staff friendly. The price (1500 rs) was high for the standard but sleeping in Delhi is very expensive.
180,"The hotel itself was reasonable and clean, especially in comparison to the majority of places in new delhi. The AC did not work for half of the time, and there was hot water for about 5 minutes in total. We were billed for 3 nights, when we had only spent two nights at the hotel."
181,"I reccomend the room 406, it has three beds and quite big room. It locates at Phar Ganj, very convinience to go to Agra. The hotel is very clean, staffs are so nice."
182,"The rooms are ok, a reasonable size with some natural light, and ours had a fridge and tv. I don't think it is being maintained too much though, there were stains down the walls which I'm sure could have been removed with a good clean."
183,Just stayed for one night. Looks very run down from the outside...a lot different from the online photos. The rooms are dirty and beds uncomfortable. Bathrooms old and dirty with no hot water. Staff unhelful and annoyingly pestering for tips despite not even helping.
184,"This is a good hotel for a max. 3 nite stay, anything more and you don't want to be located in Karol Bagh. The only food options are McDonalds and the Indian sweet shop - Bikanervala."
185,"I took the bus tour that departs from the Crest Inn. It was the off season so I was the only non-Indian, english-speaker on the bus. The driver was curt and didn't understand my questions."
186,"The Crest Inn hotel is not located in the best part of Delhi, but to their credit, once you are inside everything is brand spanking new. The shower area in the bathroom is not segregated so be prepared to have a very wet bathroom floor after you've taken a shower!"
187,The hotel is very old. The bathrooms have bath tubs which leak and the toilets do not flush properly. Breakfast is served in an untidy small room and is often not prepared preoperly. The staff were very pleasant however and tried to make our stay comfortable.
188,Bad-tempered and dishonest people. We booked the hotel through a travel agent but when we came (1AM) they told us that they hadn't any booking ; we were forced to look for an other hotel (first night in India...) in the late night... we found it thanks to the taxi driver.
189,The hotel was booked by a travel agent and the 2 star rating was lower than we had talked about. The menu was pretty good and the food reasonable priced for room service. The staff seemed friendly and helpful.
190,"Stayed at this Hotel !! on the 31 March, for one night, because my agent E- Holidays couldn't get me into the Broadway. Reception staff not very friendly, workmen on the stairs painting and repairing the lift. The room was dirty ,the bathroom was falling apart, (and this was in one of the suites !!) The dining room was just as bad. Don't go near the place!.  Pete Thompson  Melton Mowbray, England"
191,Travel agent said was one of the 'better' hotels in Karol Bagh! I would avoid and go to the Hotel Swati down the road!
192,Swimming pool and spa facility were excelent. We got hair hair cut from Silvi. Lobby is very good. Garden were very well maintained.
193,"Good service, nice and clean. Too much attention sometimes from service staff. Nice with gym inside the hotel. Good service and cleanliness."
194,The room service staff are friendly and eager to please but if you don't keep the privacy button on they knock in the hope of tips! The reception staff were rude and unhelpful on every occasion Buffet restaurant is just indian food and no variety.
195,The Crowne Plaza Delhi is 5 Star Deluxe Hotel located in the heart of New Delhi. Very very good arragment .... very very good.
196,"cozy interiors make you comfortable in the rooms. all the necessary amenities are at available, great reastaurant and nice food makes everyone happy. Convenient drop at the airport with a smiling face."
197,"I lived n Delhi or a year and have to return once a month flying in from Mumbai. The breakfast was so bad it defies description vegetarian omellete with bacon in it, uncooked eggs served as an omellette. Room service, we ordedred a salad wth bread ad they were 3 potato crisps, inedible!"
198,"The hotel is nice, the room is comforable and clean and serviced well. The reception staff were rude and unhelpful on every occasion I needed to speak wih them. My main complaint is the food. The breakfast offer is terrible - cheap nasty cereals, runny porridge and runny yoghurt."
199,"The Atrium bar is lovely and quiet but like everywhere in India expensive. Breakfast was excellent, the best we had during our tour. Would recommend this hotel if you want to stay away from the very busy city."
200,"Great staff, food and entertainment. You can rent a driver and car and tour around Delhi, which is amazing. Staff are amazing and add a very personal touch to everything."
201,Crowne Plaza should make sure that the staff &quot;Does not Humiliate and Insult its guests.Learn the Basics before even thinking of running a hotel.
202,"The service was way above standard for India, about average by Canadian standards. The rooms were the cleanest of anywhere we stayed in India. The food was average in the restaurant, but the service was quick."
203,"My room on the 6th floor was small and cramped feeling, as was the bathroom. Housekeeping was fine, but the room is starting to feel worn. The staff are well-meaning and try hard, but are not polished."
204,Overall OK but for the kind of charges they have it cld have been better. They have customised services for japanese guests like TV channels. Food is not too great for the money they charge. Better to eat out in the shopping arcade outside.
205,The staff at the Crowne Plaza Hotel New Delhi is outstanding. Room was lovely. Used hotel guide/driver for 3 days. Service slow in main restaurant and food not to our liking.
206,"The rooms are comfortable and clean. The food is good and room service very efficient. The gym is modern, well-equipped and well-managed and the pool is popular."
207,Crowne Plaza Hotel is located in the heart of New Delhi. The hotel is one of the most popular hotels in the city. The rooms are very good and the staff are very friendly.
208,"Surya has large and spacious rooms. The food is excellent. The front office staff is very efficient but not well groomed. The location is good too, considering the size of delhi."
209,five star hotelgood for official partieslocated in posh south delhicentral location in south.good servicegood foodgood food.
210,"nice and cozy environment! had a one night stay....the room was quite contemporary.. floor 3/ regular twin bed room!nice breakfast, great room service... bathroom fitted with latest amenities...defintely a recommend for any frequent travellers!"
211,The hotel has all the faclities required to unwind post the day's work. The shopping arcade is reasonably priced and shopkeepers open to negotiation so one can get a steal.
212,"Sufficiently impressive for a hotel of its star rating, but nothing makes this hotel stand out from its competitors. The location is so-so, and the surrounding area less accomodating than other parts of the city."
213,Crowne Plaza was a tad more expensive (for which read extortionate) than the admirable Nehru Place Intercontinental. The walls of the 'executive lounge' appear to have been painted by the same five year old responsible for the grouting around the shower.
214,"nice place, nice membership benefits, all facilities, centraly located.nice bufffets and everything u think is above normal grade.worth a visit really."
215,The hotel did a very poor job of organizing the leisure package that I had selected. Very poor service for what the charges are. The room are well done and the restaurants &amp; spa area is very modern. Highly recommend the ayurvedic massage.
216,If you are just looking for a good hotel just to stay for a couple of days. This hotel is a good choice. Just expect a decent Room adn nothing else including service.
217,"The rooms are excellent by any country's standards, and the staff are friendly and good fun if you make the effort to talk with them. What really stands out at the Crowne Plaza Delhi is the excellent Gym and Spa. There are brief power cuts every day (but you have to expect this) but the gym treadmills are not affected by this!!"
218,"Its an excellent hotel... Stayed there many a times on official visit... Excellent ambience, service, location, and ambience."
219,"We had three separate one night stays here during a tour in India. We were put in a disabled room, not ideal as we are both able bodied. The smell of urine hit you as you walked into the room, we quickly realised that it was coming from the air con. Would never recommend this hotel."
220,The hotel is extremely good. Rooms are lavish and beautiful. I liked the hotel rooms the most. See the room photograph below. The hotel is located in the heart of London's West End.
221,Hotel is fine for business - not too expensive but rooms getting a bit shabby and tired. Hotel gym is small and smelly and is crowded as everyone gets there at the same time after work.food is apalling and the choice of western food is disappointing.
222,"Excellent location, warm welcome and Great food. Well connected to delhi and neihghbouring states UP, Haryana etc. Very spacious lobby too, Rooma are big and has excellent view."
223,"Crown Plaza in Delhi is always a great pleasure to stay in. It has good restaurant, good rooms and good location. It is located in the heart of the Indian capital."
224,"The hotel is one of the best that I have come across in New Delhi. It has all the modern amenities that are required for a business hotel. Food is very good, variety is low but access to resteraunts in the shopping center next door makes up for this."
225,"The restaurant and bar were very nice, but really expensive. The breakfast buffet was really good, everything is geared toward Japanese and Western tourists. The service is amazing and rooms were very comfortable."
226,"After 4 visits to Delhi, this has become my hotel of choice three different times- due to my company budget policy- around $200. Recent Indian currency depreciation helped- so 9,000-10,000 rp now translates to just $200 vs over $250 6 months ago."
227,"Decent typical international chain hotel with large, clean and well equipped bedrooms and bathrooms. Nice bar and restaurants. Main problem is the location, with nothing to attract close by except for a large shopping complex. The surroinding area is quite filthy."
228,Hotel rooms in India are expensive but in this hotel you receive exactly what you need after a busy day in the city. The food of the Indian restaurant in the hotel is very good.
229,All the staff were very helpful and courteous and even those you just passed in a hallway would always smile and say hello. The cleanliness was good in the rooms and around the hotel. They have a very good Chinese restaurant on the 7th floor that has views over the city.
230,Great hotel with good service overall. The rooms are well equipped but on the small side. The pool area was a bit small and lacking but then who goes to Delhi to stay by the pool?
231,Service at the front desk was polite and efficient. They guided us well with all our inquires. Their morning breakfast at Le Cafe was good with variety.
232,Stayed here at beginning and end of tour in India booked with Jetsave. Reception area lovely and pool very nice with beds in shade. Unfortunately several swimming lessons for local children held in the pool made it crowded and noisy at evening time.
233,"New Delhi India. Crown Plaza Suyra May 14-20 2008. Eileen Queens,N.Y. stayed at the Crown Plaza new delhi India."
234,"The hotel is out of the way from the airport and main tourist areas. Rooms were OK, but walls were pretty banged up, and the bathroom smelled awful. Worst part, was getting ripped off for the airport pickup."
235,"I stayed at the Crown Plaza for three nights in April. Since I last stayed there eight years before it has had a big refit. The main open areas are airy and bright, nicely fitted out."
236,"The public spaces are spacious and flashy, and are intended to impress. My Club level room was large and comfortable. The Club level breakfast buffet was not overly large or varied."
237,The only thing which is 5star at this hotel is the price. The service is bad. Food is not good. The hotel has a problem with the air conditioning.
238,"There are a couple of ATMs within 5 Mins of hotel, quite handy as you can't get rupees before you go and the exchange desk at airport didn't take debit cards, only credit. Staff were very friendly and hotel was very modern and clean."
239,"We stayed here twice during a recent tour of India. Both times it was a welcome place to stay in a hectic city. Staff was helpful, breakfast was good."
240,Stayed at Crowne Plaza with group of 5 girls for whom this was part of India 'experience' Asked for and got all the help I needed in providing girls a once in a lifetime experience. They arranged day trip to Taj Mahal with meals and guides. Could not have been better.
241,The rooms are clean and spacious and really what you'd expect from a 4 star hotel. December - January is wedding season in Delhi and it's very busy with private functions.
242,The hotel lacks atmosphere and beware the rooms on the 1st floor. I found the service in the hotel to be below average and at times was totally ignored by staff at the hotel's reception.
243,"I spent 1 night at the Crowne Plaza Delhi and found the hotel in excellent condition. The double bedroom was large enough to move without problems. Bathroom was, like the bedroom, spotlessly clean, no mold anywhere. Breakfast buffet offered breakfast for Asian and Western tastes."
244,"Was clean, with an impressive lobby but the room was smallish, had old decor, and had a shakey door that needed to be repaired. Management were rude to my friend when she checked in, and the post cards that i gave to the bell desk (with money) never arrived in Australia."
245,Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 6 weeks while on a business trip. Hotel was clean and staff friendly. Overall an excellent hotel and will be even better once renovation works are all completed.
246,"The Surya isn't as luxurious as the Taj Palace, but the service is still pretty good. The location of this hotel is also excellent, it is within walking distance of some great resturants. The hotel also has a club, which wasn't that happening, but played some good music."
247,The rates are rather expensive and you could stay at a much better property for the same price. I was upgraded to the Premiere Club floor but was unable to partake of the amenities and perks. The spa is nothing fancy but does have a large &amp; interesting menu of auyervedic massages.
248,"Stayed there for a week, everything is nice and clean. The hotel is not closed to the center, but you can hire a 3 wheeled car, a tuc tuc, for 100 rupeehs per hour (don't pay more!). Transfer by local taxi to the International airport is 350 rupees and takes about 45min."
249,I stayed at this hotel as part of a tour. The hotel was in my opinion excellent. The restaurants were good and breakfast was excellent.
250,"Some of the rooms are a bit dated decor-wise but I believe the hotel is in the process of under going a make over. The hotel is located on the outskirts of the centre of Delhi, but as it is such a vast metropolis I would not make location an issue."
251,"Grubby hotel, may look like a 5 star from the photos- but when you get there, the place is grubby and in need of renovation. Book the Hyatt or the Grand, I wish we did from the start."
252,"Booked online with hotel website for 2 rooms under 1 name. When we arrived, they said they had 1 room for 2 people, and were sold out. After a few minutes of haggling, they had made a mistake in their hotel reservation system, and accomodated us."
253,"The Crowne Plaza was in the heart of New Delhi, with all the hustle and bustle going on around you. The dining was exceptional with 3 or maybe 4 places to eat withing the hotel itself. The staff were courteous and friendly."
254,The staff at this hotel is outstanding. I had price issues with our first night stay. The Japanese restaurant was awesome! Highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in New Delhi.
255,It was truly a 5 star experience in all the respect. Our Breakfast at Coffee shop was served by smiling and professional staff. Yes one must try the Health club which they have recently introduced with good equipments for health concious travellers.
256,"Wilson Garry stayed between 3rd Sep 06 and 07th Sep 06. Staff was highly helpful and warm in their approach. Room had features like LCD screen TV, Cubicle bath and bedside console."
257,"The Crowne Plaza in New Delhi was probably a great hotel ten years ago, but it is showing its age. Electrical outlets were iffy, the fixtures were cracked and fading, and the marble surfaces were showing a lot of wear. The hotel neglected to send a car to meet me at the airport."
258,Location is not central and away from Connaught Place but we were touring and had a car and driver so this did not seem to matter. The hotel was very quiet during our stay but the service was excellent.
259,"Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 2 nights, had an excellent room on the 7th floor. It had been recently refurbished with modern amenities including a large plasma TV. Chinese Restaurant was excellent (but not cheap)"
260,"Most of the rooms need refurbishing and the bar area has got to be the most inhospitable place in India. The breakfast is OK, but the restaurant is far too small to cope with a full house."
261,The rooms are awesome! Very much clean. The corridors and the waiting lounge was very comfortable. The bathroom was good too but with no bathtub :( (It does matter to some !)
262,"I found it extremely comfortable, very near to New Delhi Rly station travelling to the hotel by a cycle rickshow only. There is a metro entry just out side the hotel. A very good restaurant with a very reasonable price."
263,"Very warm and cozy rooms, plush interiors, nice service and tasty food. Good connectivity for business and tour planner available in the hotel. Best value for money."
264,"The quality for price cannot be beat in Delhi - for $40 you get clean rooms with satelite TV, AC, wireless (must pay but only $5 for 24 hours) and clean bathrooms. You are literally across the street from the train station."
265,The hotel is just yards from the New Delhi Sewerage Station. The large hotel is easy to see even at night time and even with luggage you can just walk across the car park. Staff were pleasant and helpful but they won't store luggage so you'll have to use the Left Luggage Office at the station.
266,We booked Ginger Delhi for 2 days and left hotel with-in 2 hours of checking-in. The hotel staff did not even check if the room was clean before handing over the room. The quilt was almost black from one side and had couple of yellow spots all over.
267,"Ginger Hotel is located in the heart of New Delhi, India. The hotel has a self-service cafeteria and there is a gym. The booking process was slow and the hotel never delivered IT assistance."
268,"Ginger hotels is a chain of hotels in India, mainly set up for business travellers. The Delhi hotel is right behind new delhi train station so centrally located for seeing the city. Rooms are very clean, flat screen tv, air con, clean sheets, clean showers, nice staff and tea/coffee in room."
269,"was clean, and appeared safe. there was ample of room with clean bedding and hot water. additionally there is a good restaurant, business station and travel desk within the lodge. railway station is 5 min walk away."
270,"I say, friends, all those of u who want cleanliness, ginger new delhi can't be ur second choice. It was so calm, peaceful and so clean that at time i felt to leave the place never. So cheap and nearby to the station it was an amazing place to live in"
271,"This hotel has small rooms for 1 person which cost about half of a standard room. It books up, mostly by locals. Not great in terms of character but great if you just need a clean and safe place to sleep."
272,A great value Hotel similar to a UK Travel Lodge. We were a party of 4 -2 adults and 2 teenagers and for 1000INR a night this was a bargain. Rooms very clean with AC and a fridge and LCD TV. Restaurant is open 24hours with good food although the staff are very rude and un anattentive.
273,"This is an excellent choice and great value for the price. The room and bathroom were clean, A/C was great, flat screen TV with cable, hot water (though much better in morning than night), very cheap phone calls, internet in the lobby and very helpful staff."
274,"Stayed one night at the beginning of our two week holiday. Support majority of positive comments already made about value, cleanliness and convenience. The restaurant was nothing great but it's only one stop by Metro to Connaught Circus."
275,"The hotel is basic but clean enough. Room has complimentary water (2 bottles a day), hot water pot, TV. There are 2 computers available in the lobby for Rs 110 for 1 hr."
276,"Ginger hotel is located next to the railway station. The room is not of a five-star quality but just of the right size. There is no room service, but you could pack your food from the restaurant."
277,"An excellent hotel strategically located with very good Customer Service. The cost of the food in the Restaurant is little higher which TATA need to relook at, as they have opened this Hotel in the Railway Station Complex."
278,"Spacious and spick and span rooms for just Rs.999/night. LCD TV, very neat toilet/shower, Complementary mineral water. Connaught Place outer circle is hardly 1 km. CP is the best place to dine."
279,"Real Value For Money hotel. An ac room at rs 999 is an steal. neat room well maintained. Has coffee / Tea maker, complimentary water bottle."
280,"Hotel is located in central Delhi. Rooms are well maintained, lobby is good. Comsum restaurent at the lobby provides yet another surprise. Good hygenic food at very good price.Overall very good experience."
281,Clean and comfortable rooms with a multi-cuisine restaurant made our trip wonderful. One of the best thing is the easy access of railway station. We strongly recommend this hotel to all the visiting couples and families.
282,"This hotel is just steps from the New Delhi train station. It has clean rooms, comfortable beds and decent bathrooms at very reasonable prices. The restaurant offers good and safe food at very competitive prices."
283,"Ginger (Yatri Nivas) New Delhi, I recommend this hotel because its clean, the staffs are very polite, No disturbance, Overall I would say you get an ambeince of a five star at the cost of 3 star hotel. Clean bedsheets, towels, wifi, A/C. Really a comfortable place to stay and at the heart of New Delhi."
284,"Great hotel with everything you need - mini fridge, flat panel TV , 4 beds in family room. Nice restaurent downstairs, WIFI for approx $8/24 hrs , pharmacy , book store next door."
285,I visited this place on my Recent visit to New Delhi. This hotel is good but is not ar per the desired standard. I know this is a budget hotel but the quality is not soo good.
286,"After so much hassle in Raunak hotel,it was a relief to come to Ginger Hotel. Even though Ginger hotel is a budget hotel, it is the best value for money."
287,"Stayed here on 2 separate occasions during March and rate the hotel very highly. Its location is walking distance from New Delhi train station which is ideal if you want to catch a train at 6 in the morning. The rooms are very clean, modern looking and have a good air conditioning system."
288,"The Ginger has all the atmosphere of a businessman's hotel, but the rooms are clean and neat. Staff is responsive to requests for assistance. What I say that &quot;Best place in Delhi to stay."
289,Ginger hotel (The erstwhile Rail Yatri Niwas) is very nice hotel. The interiors are very good. The room rates are also resonabel at around 1200 Rs.
290,"This is a budget hotel, so don’t expect any frills. You’ll find a bed, AC (little noisy), LCD TV, a desk with a small fridge and a standard western bathroom. There’s a 24 hours restaurant in the ground floor, if you like Indian food you’re going to enjoy yourself."
291,"Ginger Hotel is located near the railway station. Room is basic but clean, Wi-fi everywhere for 113 rupies per hour. Restaurant always open, not expensive and average quality food."
292,"The Ginger is cheap, clean and comfortable. Air conditioning was welcome after the May heat of the city. 24 hour cafe downstairs was useful, not the best food ever but adequate."
293,Hotel Ginger is a great buy-in for business travellers who visit the hotel only for a good night's sleep. The rooms are very tiny but well done up. The corridors are a maze but blame it on the old building and construction.
294,"The Ginger has all the atmosphere of a businessman's hotel, but the rooms are clean and neat. Service is snappy and professional. The hotel is within walking distance of Connaught Place and Old Delhi."
295,"The hotel is magnificent. It was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel to go anywhere. It;s ambience is so peaceful, no disturbance at all from anyone .  In delhi, with such a atmosphere you can not find hotel at such a reasonable rates."
296,The hotel is just a stone's throw from the railway station. A tea kettle with coffee and tea packs was provided in the room. There is a restaurant in the groundfloor that offered food and beverage round the clock.
297,"Very clean place to sleep and have a spot in the city. Do not expect a lot. Rooms are small, claustrophobic, with single window fully covered by AC machine."
298,Nothing but the best Value for Money. Easily the best option for all kind of travellers.Id give it 5/5.
299,"Ginger hotel is right next to the NEw Delhi Railway Station. The hotel is very neat and clean. They also have a restaurant, laundry service, LCD TVs in each room, etc."
300,"Good value for money. The family room contains 4 beds. With AC, pretty spacious room with LCD TV for 1000 is too good. Also proximity the New Delhi railway station is BIG plus."
301,"A good value, conveniently located hotel next to the Metro and New Delhi Railway Station. Staff were very attentive and the restaurant was adequate. We stayed four nights and the room was well cleaned every day."
302,This was one of my worst experiences!!! I finished a whole days work in delhi and had to return to this hotel in the night. The arrangement for my stay was made by my office in Mumbai. This was a chain affiliated with the TATA group.
303,"We enjoyed staying at the Ginger, New Delhi. The rooms are compact, very clean and every small detail is taken care of. Food is available at the 24-hr coffee shop at the ground level."
304,Good hotel to stay if you are travelling on business or work for a day or two. The facilities are minimal but adequate and the staff are friendly.
305,"We took a family room for just INR 1000. The quality of the beds, mattresses is very nice. The restaurant offers a very limited menu. It is something which can be improved upon."
306,Ginger hotel is truly a business hotel for a frequent business traveler like me. The facilities provided by the hotel are above average. I will definitely stay with Ginger next time I am in India's capital soon.
307,it was a gud exp.. been serviced by the ginger mgt....at the cost tat i iccured i can't even imagine a service like the one i got ..................its true to say tata as the most trustable brand of world................
308,Decent place- reasonably clean and located next to the railway station. Remember it is a budget hotel so a few things one should keep in mind. Food is available but is in a cafeteria like place.
309,"A Basic Service Hotel, right next to New Delhi Railway Station. We took a 4 Bedded Family Room as were travelling with 2 Kids and wanted a Hotel Near Railway station as we were transitting next day to Goa by Flight. The Toilet seat is installed too High making it uncomfortable."
310,"in new delhi, in area near to railway station, ginger is not only best budget hotel but with most professional management. All facilities like taxi, food, shopping is available nearby."
311,the stay at hotel was awesome with excellent room amenities.and that too too economical. jus the place outside hotel is to be maintained.
312,"It is a standard stopover hotel, like a Travelodge or a Premier Inn in the UK. It's clean, the check in and out were simple and there's a restaurant/cafe downstairs."
313,"What I like about this hotel is the central location, and the attractive price for room it provides. It is basic, yet, it has what you need, and it is clean enough. They do not provide sheets apart from the one covering the mat."
314,A great value Hotel similar to a UK Travel Lodge. We were a party of 4 -2 adults and 2 teenagers and for 1000INR a night this was a bargain. Rooms very clean with AC and a fridge and LCD TV. Location is great for those wanting to use New Delhi train station as it is only 2 mins away by foot.
315,The hotel is decent &amp; as per Ginger standards. The rooms are good&amp; clean. Its located very conviniently esp if one wants to travel from NDLS station.
316,"My friends and I booked a room at Ginger to save some money. On the drive there, our driver muttered in Hindi that 'cheaters go there' As we waited to check in, the fellow customers, all men, started casually inching closer to my friends and me."
317,Good place for a 2-3 days leisure time. Room service was quick and the food was satisfactory. The rooms were neat &amp; clean.
318,"Loved my stay here. Hotel is clean &amp; proper. Has a good restaurant as well.Rooms are self sufficient, though small if you are looking at spending more than 3 days here."
319,Ginger was just what we needed for the final 3 nights of our 3 1/2 week stay in India. The room was immaculate (by western standards rather than Indian) and complete with a fridge and tea and coffee making facilities.
320,"Good value for money, good clean room with a/c and good clean bathroom. Basic decor and a bit echoey in the corridors. The restaurant / snack bar is good (try the plain dosa)"
321,"Very nice clean hotel with good room facilities, good location just at Ajmeri gate 100m from NDRS and metro, nice stuff - willing to fully refund one mine canceled night. Hotel restaurant is a different story. It works like fast food and they had no croissants and breakfast like food at the morning even if listed in the menu. Same with fruit salad."
322,"We stayed for two nights early March and then again a week later. Both times the rooms were immaculate, we stayed in a double room costing just 999 rupees per night. The rooms are equipped with Satellite TV, kettle, tea and coffee, fridge, celan bathroom with shower curtain."
323,"Good value hotel, Clean rooms very close to the train station. good choice for a nights stay in Delhi before your onward jurney."
324,"A compact small room with wooden flooring, clean bathroom, with a telephone, air-conditioner and a cupboard with hangers was all for Rs 999. A standard room means a Queen side double bed, whereas a twin bed room are two separate beds. There is a restaurant at the ground floor (Comesum) which serves decent food options."
325,I stayed here once alone and once with my wife in January 2009 for Rs 1200. Overall a good hotel but there is a problem in getting taxi drivers to find it. Most don't recognize the address whether spoken or written down.
326,"Ginger Hotel is a no frills, and a great hotel. It's centrally located to all monuments, and shopping areas are a taxi drive away. Make sure you prebook online if you want the Family room (4 ppl for 1000INR) as it's in demand."
327,Stayed at Ginger during a short trip to Delhi in January 2009 with friends. Stay was comfortable and just what it advertised itself as - a no frills hotel. Wifi/Internet access is expensive at Rs.130/hour compared to internet rates elsewhere.
328,Hotel was good and neat and clean. As I presume they are a no frill hotel where we need to fetch our water as well. Not a bad choice for a stay next to NDLS station.
329,We stayed in 12/2008 twice for 2 nights each in a family room which sleeps 4. If you check in later or check out earlier they automatically give you a reimbursement. The surrounding area is not recommended to go for a walk.
330,"Ginger hotel is located next to an enormous parking lot for rickshaws as well as the train station. The hotel isn't five-star but for the price, it's definitely recommended!"
331,My friend is stranded in Delhi because Ginger Hotel didn't honor her reservation. So...BE CAREFUL. Double check that they are ready for you. Otherwise it's a great place to stay.
332,"Best things were front desk svc, 24hr restaurant, cleanliness, uninterrupted hot and cold running water, free water bottles, free tea &amp; coffee, and access to a safe. Biggest issue was inconsistent housekeeping svc; e.g. some days we got only 1-2 towels or no TP for 4 people; one day no svc at all. WiFi broke the 2nd day and never got fixed, even though they said it would be fixed within a couple of hours."
333,"Stayed at the Ginger New Delhi, mainly because of the location. It was a few mins walk to the train station and metro line so that is why we chose it. Overall, it was really good value for money, clean hotel and friendly staff."
334,"The selection of hotels in Delhi swings from the cheap to the ridiclious. The Ginger seemed to be a hotel that served the purpose of being a safe,clean bed for a couple of nights."
335,Ginger Hotel is located near the Delhi Metro station. Rooms are available for two people. The food at the restaurant is edible. The live music at the hotel restaurant is pretty good.
336,"This is the best value hotel I've ever been to. Its thoroughly modern, with all the basic facilities (including payed Wi-Fi at rooms) The location is good too, with Metro station right outside."
337,i have recently gone through a very fantastic service in the hotel industry in india. The service provided to me was through the hotel ginger in new delhi. The price of the hotel is fair enough to shell my wallet.
338,I usually go on my bussiness trip to New Delhi. I prefer to stay in in Ginger Hotel. It has all the facilities that any four star hotels would have. Good Bed and superb guest service.
339,There is a 24 hour medical shop and a vending machine for those late night hunger pangs. All of this for less than a thousand bucks !!
340,"Cleanest hotel we had in whole India in this price range around 1000Rs. Reservation by internet or phone. TV, a/C, 24h warm water, clean linen."
341,No one could imagine such an excellent stay at the heart of New Delhi. The room was perfectly Clean. I will definitely opt this hotel again if I visit Delhi again.
342,Ginger Hotels is a new Budget range Hotels from Tata Group operated with the brand name Ginger. The Rooms are with Dark Shades with basic interiors and Hot &amp; Cold Water. No Room Service is provided and they manage with few staff and thats where they are able to cut down the costs.
343,"Grand Godwin is a fantastic hotel, such great value for money. The beds were fairly comfortable and the rooms were very clean. The restaurant is 24 hr and the food is great. Good breakfast too."
344,"Stayed there last year when Delhi was the first stop on the India trip. The rooms were OK, not splendid (relatively clean, though). Substantially overpriced, however, compared to those in hotels on the same street."
345,"Stayed at the Grand for one night on our way through Delhi to Udaipur. Room was comfortable and clean, check-in was quick and easy. The roof-top restaurant offeres an expansive breakfast."
346,"Good hotel in a nice area, near metro station and interesting spots. Especially having breakfast at the roof top in the morning is really nice."
347,"I enjoyed my 3 day stay here. Room service was very kind, food was excellent and the room was clean. Only negative is that I had constant trouble with Internet."
348,"An excellent choice near New Delhi Station. We first stayed one night in room 402 at the beginning of our tour of India. It is true that the neighbourhood is noisy but in the hotel, it is very quiet."
349,We had a semi deluxe room; we had booked it on their website a month in advance. We arrived late at night and it took a while for them to find our booking confirmation. The restaurant was OK and b'fast an interesting buffet affair.
350,"Breakfast is not very good (don't bother trying to get something else thant a Nescafé in 90% of indian restaurants&amp;hotels), but you can get eggs, fruit juice,tea, toasts etc no problem. I would advice to give it a try to the roof-top restaurant, non-expensive and tasty."
351,I made a reservation weeks before arriving in Delhi and specifically asked for a driver to pick me up because it was my first time in India. They sent me a confirmation with booking and pick up driver but upon arrival on the airport nobody was there.
352,"This is the best and also the most popular hotel in the area. The room is decent, but bathroom could be better equipped. The roof top resturant is not bad, the breakfast was better than we expected."
353,"Incredible India helped us greatly with rearranging hotels for us in different cities. It was especially great to have them help us in the middle of the night, when we arrived from the airport first day."
354,"The bedroom was terrible, very dirty and we found some cockroaches in the bathroom. We booked it in advanced paying and they didn't keep our reservation. After one hour of argument we got the room we had booked."
355,"Stay away at any cost. The place is located in the slum areas around Delhi central station. I'll be looking for another hotel tomorrow, don't waste your time here."
356,"Location, breakfast and staff service terrible. Rooms are ok size, there is no bath just a wet room shower. Breakfast on the roof top is poor, only the omlette or cereal is worth eating."
357,"The Grand Godwin has perfectly fine rooms, although the bathrooms are a little compact. It's well located for convenience to New Delhi train station...great if you intend to travel around India by train. The staff are pleasant and helpful and internet access reasonabely priced."
358,"Generally great... clean, smart, good location but.. generally little niggles. Breakfast is a buffet set up and was cold and generally quite disgusting. Evening meals meanwhle are overpriced and nothing special."
359,The hotel is located in the Paharganj section of Delhi. The sidewalks are very narrow and often covered with street vendors. The restaurant was quite good (for breakfast and dinner)
360,"It the damaging for me when i was arrived in India. They charge me the room rent also high 1800INR + 22.5 Tax for one day. I can't recommend to any single lady, couple, senior citizen to stay this hotel."
361,The hotel is extremely clean and well equipped. The staff are attentive and courteous. When I had a problem with a scammer who stole my money they went out of their way to help me.
362,"The hotel is conveniently located about 2 minutes by tuktuk from the train station. The staff arranged airport pickups for us twice, and they were always there waiting for us. The rooms were clean as well as all the bed sheets, and comfortable."
363,"Hotel Grand Godwin is located on a busy street in Parhaganj, about a 3-4 minute walk from the train station. Staff were friendly and efficient, booking an airport taxi for us and arranging for breakfast in our room at 4:30 am before our flight."
364,The hotel is a 10/15 min walk from the main bazar or a 20 rupee cycle rickshaw ride. The rooms were a good size and clean and the breakfast served at the roof top restaurant was particulary good.
365,"The staffs of the hotel, specially the front office are very helpful. My room is only US$45 per night with break first. Secure airport transfers and sight visit tour arranged by the hotel."
366,All the staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms and linens were very clean. The breakfast buffet on the roof terrace was fine although I didn't sample the evening cuisine. The hotel is only a ten minute walk from Connaught Circus.
367,I booked this hotel on recommendations from other reviews. Stayed 3 nights and the biggest problem was the cleanliness of the room. The bedding on both beds had many stains and soiled areas and seems to have not been washed.
368,"The noisy /dirty side street location of the hotel is a bit off putting, but inside it is clean and comfortable and efficiently run. Do not confuse this hotel with the Godwin Hotel next door which is truly awful but run surprisingly by the same owners. We were informed that it is due to be demolished and rebult in 2009."
369,We arrived at 3 am and after battling with a pre-paid taxi driver who suddenly couldn't find the hotel arrived with the [--]. They had us sorted and in our room. We didn't much like it so next day requested to change and did so to a front street facing room which was fantastic. The breaky was great and hearty and the restaurant even served pretty good dishes for lunch. The location is the only issue. If your female expect heaps of hassles and expect heap of poverty.
370,"Hotel Grand Godwin is a budget hotel in Delhi, India. The rooms were clean, bathroom okay (Indian budget bathrooms you take your chances), nice people working there, and a good spiral staircase."
371,Our room was serviced daily and we also had a newspaper delivered every morning. We were able to walk to Connaught Place to shop at Fabindia and the official Cottage Industries shop and beyond.
372,"Don't bother making a booking. If the hotel is full, they'll give away your room to anyone walking in off the street. I watched them give away a room 5 mins after a guest booked it - in person - while he was down the street getting his luggage."
373,"Great hotel to stay at, in the less touristy part of paharganj but does not suffer from it. Roof top bar is good too.Rooms clean, beds comfy."
374,Great location very close to New Delhi train station which was perfect for an early morning train journey to Agra or anywhere else. The hotel is on a street that runs parallel with the main bazaar but isn’t directly on it. Main bazaar has great shopping for your typical traveller.
375,"The hotel is a short walk to the New Delhi train station. It is also a short autorickshaw ride to many New Delhi sites such as India Gate, C.P., and museums. The rates are good, the rooms are clean, and if I remember correctly they offer complimentary breakfast."
376,"We booked one night at the Grand Godwin, our first night in India as well as the airport taxi. The more you engage their staff, the more they are friendly and try to help. The breakfast is delightful on top of the roof and all other meals we had there were good as well."
377,Hotel Grand Godwin was clean and nice but I'd be hard pushed to recommend it. We stayed in room 203 (no windows) and were constantly woken by the noise of other people showering in their rooms.
378,The rates are great and the staff (most but not all) are friendly and helpful and gracious. The food is really good and the breakfast buffet is totally worth is. The Metro is really very nice and worth using to travel around Delhi.
379,Hotel is ok but the team is a very big problem. If the manager is not there it's not possible to find a solution. Twice we had to pay more that was agreed. If we didn't we have missed our planes.
380,"The hotel is located in the heart of the city, close to cannaught place and the railway station. The restaurant small but good food, and the serve a buffet breakfast very good. They also have a travel agent who can arrange you a pre-paid taxi or any other thing you need for a reasonable price."
381,"Don't expect the hotel that you will have booked your room in to be like one of the hotels in Toronto or Chicago or Auckland or Melbourne. NEVER book through any online consolidators (Expedia, Travelocity, etc) even if it is a few dollars cheaper. Most hotel managers (not all) will smile, bend over backwards for you and while doing that, will empty out your pockets."
382,Hotel is on a busy street close to New Delhi Railway Station. Booking was a breeze with the excellent website. I paid $35 for a single including breakfast.
383,The room was reasonably clean but not free of the occasional scurrying cockroach. The hot water facilities were pathetic but otherwise the bathrooms were clean and functional. The night staff at the reception were rude and ill-trained.
384,"The hotel lobby is snazzy w/ marble and a glass elevator. The room (single, Deluxe) was on the smaller side but was clean and nice. The restaurant on the top floor surprised us because it had really wonderful food."
385,"A block away from Ajanta where we had stayed at the start of our tour. Modern bedrooms and helpful staff. The 2000rps cost included a good breakfast, but not an airport pick-up."
386,"The hotel was clean, very nicely appointed and service good. We were in room 309, a little noisy (but we slept fine) from the street. Just ask for a room on the side if you need very quite sleeping time."
387,"Hotel will aggressively try to sell you as many things as it can in terms of guided tours, etc. The lobby is nice enough - and that's all they show you on their website. The room was dingy and smelled."
388,"Nice and clean hotel but do not prepay! They raised our rate when we got there although we paid a month before arriving with a credit card through their website. They gave us an 'employee room', not the superior room we booked until we paid an additional amount."
389,"Pahar Ganj is a rundown, cheap traveller area. However, the area was safe to walk around and a convenient location. Overall the rooms (both the deluxe and superdeluxe) were a great size."
390,This hotel was quite a good experience for us. It is certainly not fancy but more than adequate. The rooms were clean and the hotel staff were organized and helped us with our travel arrangements. In all honesty Delhi is not a place where you will spend alot of time.
391,Room was very dark and dingy with only one window that lead to a concrete wall. we also had a guy outside our room all of the time who kept spitting. try to avoid as they clearly don't clean the sheets.
392,"We booked to stay here 12th October 2007 on our first night in India, then again for the 20th - 22nd October 2007 for our last 2 nights. The sheets to the bed however were really disgustingly dirty, but we'd thought ahead and brought our own sheets and pillow cases. Our real problem with this hotel came with our &quot;CONFIRMED BOOKING&quot;"" for the last two nights of our holiday. I called to check the reservation, after hearing of other peoples hotel problems, and was told that we had no booking, that they had never heard of us and that we'd never previously stayed at that hotel."
393,"I tried to check in to the hotel but encountered unprofessional, discourteous and rude staff at the front desk. I was asked for a picture ID and I gave my international driver's license. The hotel manager sent it outside the building to get a photo copy."
394,Both &quot;suites were clean and fairly spacious. The showers were open (no door/curtain) The toilets were a bit dirty but ok. Breakfast was served on a roof terrace.
395,"Review prepared by two senior citizen couples that have traveled extensively in the far east. Stayed in this hotel on two occasions for one night each at a cost of $42 per night per room including breakfast. Hotel personnel were friendly, courteous and very professional."
396,"We originally stayed in this hotel for a few nights in Jan after being recommended to it by a couple we met at another establishment. Sheets were revolting - covered in pubic hairs and clearly not laundered in between guests. At 1500 rupees it's not a cheap hotel for Delhi so I would definitely recommend NOT staying here, EVER!"
397,"The hotel is only two minutes walk from the Grand Bazar and the New Delhi train station. The room was fine, perhaps not up to European standards (good cleaning could help) The best was the restaurant: quite cheap and really good."
398,"Our stay at the Grand Godwin was simply average. The rooms are clean but the washroom do not have bath tubs or proper shower areas. If you are looking for clean washroom, DO NOT stay here. Its quite basic but cheap."
399,Rooms are ok but the Super Deluxe rooms dont have fridges and so you can't chill your drinks etc. They also have a Travel and tourism desk but the bloke who runs it seems a bit of a dodgy character.
400,"This small, friendly, cheap, clean hotel is by far the best option I found in Delhi in the 3-star range. Conveniently located next to the train station, it's the perfect place to stop while traveling through Delhi."
401,Excellent Hotel and Brilliant Staff with reasonable price ... I stay in the hotel from 20 – 21 August 2009. All staff was very helpful and cooperative … especially the receptionist.
402,"I am very pleased with the staff. Staff is very courteous. It is not enough to have good staff. The owner/management should have good outlook and try to improve the condtions. Air Conditioning is not adequate, Staff maintains the rooms and bath rooms to their ability. Any bath tub or commode will go bad inspite of regular maintenance. It has to be replaced at one point."
403,"I stayed here for almost a week while attending a conference in the same hotel. Found the place quite good in terms of the rooms, amenities, facilities like the restaurant and conference setup."
404,We wre around 18 doctors stayed in Grand sartaj . execlent Hospiltality given by staff neat n clean place to stay. reasonble price. Food was exeClent . Parking a little problem.
405,"We stayed at this hotel for one night, out 1st night in Delhi, it was a horrible experience.It is close to a main road, but not within walking distance to anywhere, very noisy all night!Bugs in the room.The breakfast was terrible and overpriced."
406,"Our first stop in India, looks nothing but comfortable rooms and well sited for shops and sights. The staff couldn't do enough for us, we left our safe open in the room while we went for breakfast and the boy making up the beds drew it to our attention when he could have easily helped himself. Also when my husband was struck with Delhi belly, pretty inevitable, they immediately let us have our room for another night."
407,When our car pulled up it appeared to be an abandoned parking lot. The outside of the building looking like it was being prepared for demolition. With only two lifts for the guests they cannot cope. After all this we checked out 2 days early.
408,"Hans Plaza is a tall tower, I think 17 stories if memory serves. Free Wifi if you stay more than 2 nights, and also buffet breakfast (excellent) and a meal voucher for two people every day."
409,"Rooms are clean, well decorated. Food is OK but very costly. Its recommended for business trip. View of the capital city Delhi from room’s window is marvelous."
410,We liked all the positive aspects described by other reviewers. I liked the restaurant with a view of trees. Its only a short walk to circus area with shops and restaurants.
411,Staff extremely attentive to your needs and my room stay was extended when they realized that i had an evening flight to catch. My room was also automatically upgraded from executive to deluxe upon my arrival.
412,This was my fourth visit to this hotel. Every visit of mine was same with warm welcome. Rooms are on very higher floor with view of the city. It is just excellent.
413,It was a great experience at Hotel stay. Staff and service was excellent. Location of the Hotel was good. Close to shopping area CP of delhi.
414,My office arranged for the hotel accomodation for this trip and i did not expect to have a hotel room on the 18th floor. The room size was adequate but the carpet could do with some vacumming.
415,"Have stayed at this hotel about 5/6 times during my business visit. Centrally located, very good restaurants, clean rooms and overall a very nice place to stay."
416,Hotel is in central Delhi and is only about 10 minutes walk from Connaught Place. The restaurants are good although a little on the expensive side. Breakfast is a mix of indian and western food.
417,"The hotel was part of a tour package. My room was clean, the bed comfortable and staff very attentive. Although the outside noise could filter up to my top floor room."
418,"Excellent hotel although slightly overpriced. Clean comfortable rooms. Great location. Helpfull staff, but extras such as tours organised through the hotel more expensive than at other hotels."
419,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights for the start of a 3.5 week tour of India and was pleasantly surprised. The room, although not very large, was beautifully appointed."
420,The room is wonderfully clean with a great bed and good room service. The location is gold but still a rickshaw is required as there are plenty of pathetic touts around the hotel.
421,The hotel was only a few minutes drive to the train for Agra as well. The lobby is pleasant and the staff were always helpful. There is a pretty good mixed Asian/North American breakfast buffet.
422,"The Hans Hotel is a mid-range hotel in a convenient location. The hotel restaurant offers both Indian and Western food and the standard is quite high. The location is convenient, being 5-10 minutes walk from Connaught Place."
423,Rooms are on par with a 4 star hotel in UK and all the amenities were present. Walls are quite thin so you could hear next door which was the only down side. Breakfast was included although it adequate and not spectacular.
424,Located close enough to many restaurants and shops but the hotel floors are high enough that you are not disturbed by traffic noises. Very clean and nice hotel. Excellent breakfast.
425,"Stayed 2 nights at the Hans Hotel in November, 2008. Didn't actually stay in the room much, as I was on tours all day. This is one of the least expensive, but nicer hotels."
426,"We booked three rooms for our family members on our way back to Auckland after the marriage of our son in Amritsar. Showers in the room leaked, toilet paper was rationed as if there is a world wide shortage. The Italian Restaurant meal had a fly cooked in our fried egg- miraculously they did not charge us for that meal."
427,This hotel is in the heart of the city and centrally located. There were so many issues including the additional dollars they charged for a cancelled night. The manager was least helpful if trying to work with a customer who has been to the hotel before.
428,"The Hans is a five star hotel in New Delhi, India. It is the most expensive hotel I have stayed at in India. The bathroom only had one towel, and the shampoo bottle was already opened and previously used."
429,stayed 2 days in the hotela great reward to end your trip in indiathe best hotel i have ever beena bit expensive for india but worth it.
430,This hotel is located at a great location close to Jantar Mantar and a Metro Station. The food served at the Kaffa restaurant at the Hans is better than all of the Five Star Hotels that I've stayed at in New Delhi. The staff was friendly and cooperative and the rooms were EXTREMELY clean.
431,The Hans Plaza is a clean and centrally located hotel which offers one a sense of comfort at what seems to be a reasonable price for Delhi ($150 inc. taxes per night). Overall staff was very friendly - but one has to be careful of a few things: There are vast differences b/w the different rooms with regard to confort and age of beds etc.
432,"This was a great hotel for the price. It does not have all the fancy frills and thrills that the five star hotels in Delhi have. The resteraunts at the hotel are good, and offer a variety of foods to eat."
433,"The rooms were a good size and start on the 15th floor, going up to the 20th floor from what I could tell by the buttons in the lift (floors 5-14 were missing) This meant for good views over Delhi from the room, which was great as I could watch the black kites circling in the sky outside. The beds were a decent size and comfortable, and although the room felt very cold, at least the air conditioning was adjustable."
434,"Hans Hotel is a pretty nice place. The rooms are big, the views are nice and the restaurant is good. The location is quite good also, right in the heart of New Delhi."
435,"The hotel provided a welcoming plate of fruit and cookies upon my late arrival after 1 am. Overall it was utilitarian rather than elegant, but the condition of everything was excellent."
436,We stayed here as part of a private tour and I was impressed with the hotel. It's not in the same league as the big name hotels but I'd stay here again.
437,"Stayed at the Hans Hotel (no longer Hans Plaza) beginning of October. Reception was friendly. The rooms are on the 14 th floor, so there is an excellent view over delhi."
438,"Hans Plaza is a large, convenient hotel in Delhi in the $200-$300 range after taxes. It is an overpriced city. The Indian food was better than the western."
439,An average hotel with lifts that dont work. I made a five minute call to the UK and they tried to charge me over £40.
440,The Hans Hotel is well located in Conaught Place. It ia a bit poor hotel for the price. In Europe you would get a far better hottel fot the price you pay.
441,"Hans Plaza in New Delhi is a budget style, very basic hotel with a 4 star price tag. The rooms were dreadful, small and pokey and threadbare. The Imperial Hotel was one of the best hotels we have stayed in ever."
442,Twin rooms were a good size but it gets a little cramped with the extra bed. TV has over 60 channels but most were in Hindi though there is StarMovies &amp; HBO. Bathroom only have showers (no bathtub) but clean and water pressure is good.
443,"Great location, within walking distance to great restaurants, shopping and subway/metro station right around the corner. The restaurant has good breakfast (Indian and Western)."
444,A fabolous hotel run by a wonderful team. Personalized but at the same time professional. The rooms were spec and clean at all times. The USP of Hans is the splendid view you will have of Delhi from the rooms.
445,"Hans Plaza is a well situated hotel. I was pleasantly surprised with my room, it was larger than average, very clean and of a high 4-star standard. The staff were courtious and very helpful."
446,"Rooms - clean and comfortable - great views over New Delhi. Staff here very friendly, although getting a cup of tea in the morning is a bit of an effort.Location - good central location."
447,"The hotel is close to shopping and has easy access to both New and old Delhi. The room was adequate in size, modern in facilities, comfortable, and clean."
448,"We arrived at 1 p.m. and needed to rest after a long flight. They were repairing a sewer pipe in the next room, hammering it out of concrete. The wait time for food was exceptionally long and the restaurant Manager lined up three of the restaurant staff and started shouting at them in front of customers."
449,Staying in this hotel is really an awful experience which started from the reservation for me. Cable TV was out of order in 2 out of 4 nights I stayed there. From hot water tap once muddy water came out. The electric kettle for tea/coffe in the room had a UK plug which of course does not work in India. The remote control for TV was broke.
450,"Hans Plaza Hotel is located in the centre of the city. The hotel is one of the most expensive in the city, with rooms costing up to £2,000 a night."
451,We booked this hotel on-line. The photos shown were not like the hotel. Internet connection was done via WIFI and very expensive because it was so slow. The roof top resturants was closed too.
452,"We stayed 2 nights in Hans Plaza at arrival and departure from India in Feb-March 06. First time, the room needed renovation but the second room on the 17th floor was OK with a superb view. The lobby area is not very accomodating but the staff was friendly and helpfull."
453,Stayed in this hotel as part of group a three families. Had no problems with our accommodation: it was clean and warm. Restaurant staff charming. Food excellent!
454,"A very nice hotel. Lack of facilities of pool, gym, etc., but the staff are very good and kind. Breakfast buffet is decent."
455,"Dont stay at this hotel if you can help it...disgusting service and manky rooms. Toilet looked clean but there was a nasty smell, the shower was broken! electricity kept cutting out because I was trying to warm up my baby's milk in the kettle."
456,"The room's lock is broken, tv signal is of very poor quality. They also seem to cheat people on the rates mentioned on their website. As soon as you talk to them they change the rates especially if you are foreigner."
457,"I stayed in the Hans Plaza for 3 nights over a 10 day period and was impressed with 2 of the nights I stayed there. Was given a very nice room on the 19th floor each time with excellent decor and in room facilities - good size bathroom also. The 3rd night I checked in there I was given a room which was far inferior to their other rooms. No bathtub, no coffee/tea facilities and not even bedspreads on the beds. In my opinion only 3 star standard for these rooms. I would stay here again but only if guaranteed one for their newer rooms."
458,"I've stayed in Hans Plaza in September 2004. Although the rooms need renovation and the reception area is not that comfortable, I still found it value for money. Connaught Place and Janpath are 15 min. walk away."
459,I am not sure if it is worth to stay into this hotel. I think it is too expensive for what it is. They ripped us off with the taxi cost.
460,Hotel was under construction so difficult to find. Didn't feel very safe at night. Rooms were dodgy (run down and dusty) well overpriced.
461,It was a clean and economically priced hotel right on Connaught Place. Nothing fancy but great as a centrally located place as we came back through Delhi for one night on our way home.
462,Hotel 55 is an adequate hotel with a 70's styled interior. It is centrally located in Connaught Place and thus convenient for exploring. Bedding was musty but clean and the decor is average.
463,"Rooms are clean, staff are friendly, good airport pick up. Be aware of unscrupulous travel agents that roam around and in the hotel."
464,"The &quot;55&quot;"" is located in the heart of New Delhi. The tariff is not bargain basement, but given its plus points I wouldn't stay anywhere else."
465,"Stayed about three nights; safety and courtesy was not an issue for us. Staff was nice and helpful; my emails were always promptly replied to. Rooms are small, bathrooms are purely functional but grotty and inconsistent. Only one shower actually worked; only one provided hot water."
466,thes hotel it is Very good and Comfortable and Good service and the most important thing in Central City I stayed three days in it.
467,"Hotel 55 is a one star hotel with 15 rooms. The breakfast menu was a bit limited, but the food was very good. I would not recommend drinking the hotel's tap water."
468,This is probably the worst hotel that I've resided in New Delhi. The rooms were terrible and moldy. I still remember opening the wardrobe and a flurry of mosquitoes burst out; It was horrifying.
469,"Hotel 55 from the lonely planet is the most squalid and disgusting place i've ever seen (and i've stayed in some dives). Words cannot describe how repulsive this place really is. The hotel website is incredibly misleading and claims to be 3 star, when I would question how it was ever classified as a 1 star."
470,If you are expecting any kind of luxury you will be disappointed. But if you want reasonably priced (in terms of its excellent location) basic accomodation than you can't go wrong.
471,"Hotel 55 was the cheapest we could find but 3000rp (about $80) for this dump was a complete rip off. OK sized room, dirty bathroom, fantastically noisy both from outside and in."
472,"This is absolutely the worst place i have stayed in while in India! It's a windowless, grotty and filthy room smelling of gasoline, with the noise of about 10 indian guys yelling their head off until the early hours in front of your door."
473,"our hearts sank when we walked into our bedroom. it was a complete dump with a rubbish bed and whilst technically it did have an ensuiteshower, i wouldn't have washed a dog in it. another aspect was that at night time there were permanently men sleeping in the corridor right outside our room - i don't know if they were meant to be security, but one was a really skinny old man with a big long beard. you hear them talking when you used the toilet or even when you were lying in bed. when we checked out the owner tried to charge me for 2 nights despite the fact i'd paid online for the first night. at the time i thought it was an innocent mistake but having read some of the other reviews i'm now wondering about that.would never go near this dump again and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
474,Arrived late at night on train and didn't really have any other options. Best advise stay as far away from here as you can. Try something around main bazaar much cheaper and alot nicer.
475,I booked their driver to pick me up from airport and he didn't turn up. They admitted 'cheating' me out of money but refused to refund it. They said they would call the police if I didn't leave immediately without refund.
476,"We ended up staying here after our travel agent switched us last minute. Staff were rude and dismissive, rooms were like a prison cell and really dirty. The worst thing was the bad smell that was everywhere, the lobby, the rooms, the corridors!! Yuck!"
477,The hotel charges around Rs 4500/= per night for double room. The main advantage of this hotel is its proximity to the best resturants and shopping place in delhi. There is a Mc Donalds right below the hotel.
478,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in Feb 2008. It was my 4th visit to India, and this is the worst hotel I've seen. We were given a camp bed, which promptly collapsed. The showers don't provide hot water in the night."
479,"Unless you are on a budget ($80 and less) stay elsewhere. Don't expect an Indian experience if you stay in Connaught area as its full of touts, crap shopping and food."
480,"Hotel Alka is a place you really have to avoid if you're planning to stay in Delhi. We booked a double room from Italy, looking at the pictures on their site. When we arrived the room (not cheap as it costs at least 3000 Inr) was the smallest room I've ever seen and without even a WINDOW."
481,"Hotel is in excellent location but is quite dingy and not even two star rating. Hotel arranged airport transfer, it cost 925 rs really too much. Most rooms has no natural light."
482,The hotel rooms are not worth talking about. They are unclean and we had a job to get the sheets and towels changed daily. The coffee shop has about 10 waiters who simply wait and watch the TV despite being called for help several times.
483,"Hotel Vikram in Lajpat Nagar, south delhi was clean and lovely and smelled great. Its central but being central in Delhi isn't neccesarily a good thing, it's a really dirty city."
484,"The Alka Hotel is in Connaught Place in the very heart of New Delhi. It's a relatively clean and tidy small hotel, but the decor is dated. The decorators - back in 60's or 70's - went beserk with mirrors!"
485,"One of the travel agents booked this hotel for us (myself, wife and two children) for two nights. We were booked into a deluxe room, which when shown brought my wife to tears. No hot water, unclean (I am being polite) linen and floors."
486,"Spent 5 nights there, and it WAS a disgrace. I was in tears the moment we got there. The lady at the desk was rude, and just did not seem bothered: she kept answering the phone instead of checking us in. Got to our room and realised why it was so dark....there was no windows, it was small and cramped."
487,"We stayed there for 5 nights and I can't say we were very pleased with anything except the Vega restaurant. The staff speak/understand very litle English, our promised (confiremd via email) hotel airport pickup service never arrived and we never got a clear explanation of why... The rooms are small and old. They are also dusty, toilets leak, bathrooms have broken tiles."
488,"Stayed in Alka for 3 nights, do not believe the 4* rating, the hotel would be lucky to score 2* in any other countries. The room was falling apart, with mirrors all around but no natural light. The airconditioning had to be turned on by ringing up the reception. The only good thing about the hotel is probably their vegetarian restaurant, Vega."
489,"In short - horrible location, albeit central, on squalid Connaught place. Cramped, dirty rooms with no window and substandard soundproofing. Staff were rude, and were aggrieved when we didn't give them a tip."
490,Staff were intent on a) getting tips from us and b) entering our room for various &quot;reasons. At one point one of the staff knocked on our door to tell us they had beer for sale (!).
491,Stayed for 3 nights. The room was clean and the staff was the best. They also had amazing food from room service. Quiet at night as well and close to the markets.
492,Location is OK. Relatively quiet street with markets at one end of street. Felt quite safe walking around in the evening. Is a 10 minute autorickshaw ride from Connaught Place.
493,"The room had NO windows, the bed had a bottom sheet and on the top was just a blanket - no top sheet. I was supposed to stay 2 nights but I took a taxi into town and got a flight out of India for the next day. This hotel was listed on an International Hotel site and I have written to them about my concerns."
494,"This was our first stop in India and was organised through the tour company. There was nothing wrong with this hotel, the rooms were clean, the staff were friendly and honest. The location was quiet at night."
495,"A clean place,friendly staff , a good place to start an India tour. Although it was 3.00a.m when we arrived, everybody was extremely helpful. I cannot imagine a better place."
496,"The service was definitely the best amongst all the hotel we have stayed at during our India tour. The Massala Chai was to die for; we ordered it everyday without fail. The rooms were very clean, the furnishing new and the toiletries provided of a 5* standard."
497,"Hotel Aster Inn is a newly established hotel in New Delhi. The rooms were nice and clean, true to the advertising on their website. It is well located, within reasonable reach of New Delhi centre."
498,"thiz was the statrting point in india...as my flight got delayed...the driver was still there a fresh waiting for me with a smile. i was happy that theze people have real pictures on there website of the room they were havin,i got one of them...yeppei."
499,"This place was awful! The location is terrible, possibly one of the worst areas of Delhi. They don't make up your room during your stay... no clean sheets or clean towels! The food arrives on yellow plastic plates, toast wrapped in tin foil."
500,"The hotel was an oasis - friendly, attentive staff and clean rooms. It was also close to the metro, making it easy to get about without shouting for a taxi."
501,"The hotel is a comparative oasis to the bustling and grubby streets that surround it. It's only a five-minute walk to the excellent, if limited, metro system."
502,Hotel is in the heart of Karol Bagh - great for shopping. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfasts were delicious and the traditional masala tea addictive.
503,"Air-con and hot shower was no problem, and there was even a fridge! - hotel staff was very courteous, helpful, efficient and speaking perfect English."
504,Aster hotel is just 1 km walking from Jandewalan metro station. Just one station from famous market (Ramakrishna Ashram Marg metro stop) and 5-6 from Chandi Chowk.
505,Telephone booking is always confirmed whenever I have stayed here. Check-in is smooth. Sevice is good. Breakfast is always complimentary which is a plus.
506,Hotel is in the centre of Delhi but is too far away from the airport. The room was very dirty and there were flies and even a cockroach in the bathroom. The area around the hotel was not very nice and you wouldnt want to venture out at night.
507,The hotel is ok as backpacker hotel. The staff is very nice and helpful. But be careful not to accept any extra service from this hotel.
508,Hotel Ivory Palace can best be described as a flea pit. We paid for a super deluxe room (their premium room) with separate bed and a cot for the children at $67.00 AUD a night (2345 INR) We were provided with a room that had:. One bed for all four of us and when we complained an extra mattress was thrown on the floor. Unclean bedding. A hot water system that did not work. Strong kerosene odour for the entire duration of our stay. No clock radio. No coffee and tea making facilities. No complimentary newspapers. No in-room safe.
509,This hotel is one of the small hotels located in crammed up localities of Old Delhi. It is recommended if money and price are a issue for you.
510,"Good place, only several minutes from New Delhi railway station. Marble floor, the staff is nice, asked me for water several times, but finally charge me 50Rs, it's OK. The room is clean, and the hotel price is reasonable cheap!"
511,"We booked a suite thru expedia, selecting the hotel based on its free airport pick up advertised. We arrived at midnight, no one was there. Eventually we arrived, gave our itinerary # and we given a small room. We showed our papers in the am, the manager said the clerk had bad eyesite. We we upgraded to a slightly larger room."
512,The Broadway is a reasonably budget hotel located on the edge of Old Delhi. The rooms we stayed in were of an acceptable standard -not exactly luxurious but you get what you pay for.
513,"It was anice place to stay. You could enjoy a nice place to live as well as a nice location to wander about. So, i liked the place while my stay with some of my friends."
514,"I would never go back to sleep, I would go back for dinner, the restaurant is very nice, the staff is helpful. However the hotel is very old, and being wakep up by the mosque every morning at 6 am is not my cup of tea."
515,It's not a particularly quiet hotel to be honest. We seemed to be lucky in that we got one of the rooms in the back with a view of the Mosque. It's a beautifully furnished hotel and has a certain old world charm to it.
516,"The staff were prompt in providing room service, and kept the rooms clean over the two weeks. The breakfast buffet was was more than adequate. The Muslim neighborhoods behind the hotel are interesting to walk in, but better to go in a group."
517,"I stayed here in a mixture of rooms for approx 4 nights - 2 nights in cheaper rooms which were dirty, noisy and old. The bar is seedy as they come, food overpriced and general hotel over-rated. Wouldnt return here ever, save your money and go elsewhere."
518,I read all the reviews and tried to keep an open mind. When we arrived in the lobby everything went smoothly. They took us up to our room where the hall was cluttered with carts I got worried until we entered the room. spacious beautiful bathroom. comfortable large bed. loved it. overlooked the mosque enjoyed call to prayer.
519,"We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Broadway. The room was OK (the view was nice, but the room was quite noisy) The breakfast was great and the staff were very friendly. We ate at the restaurant (Chor Bizarre) several times."
520,"The hotel was booked as part of a package tour of Rajasthan and Agra. The common areas were quite clean and attractive, including the breakfast room. The room itself was fairly large, with twin beds, and nicely appointed."
521,"My son and I had dinner at the hotel's much praised restaurant, Chor Bizarre, in 2004. I thought I might take all my meals at the Chor. Breakfast offered just two kinds of eggs -- scrambled one day, hard boiled the next. The entrees I ordered at lunch and dinner were good, not great."
522,"The Broadway is on Asaf Ali Rd right next to Delhi gate. It's ideally located for exploring Old Delhi,Jama Masjid and the Red Fort. The downstairs restaurant is excellent and always busy with Indians and foreigners alike."
523,"We were 9 persons staying at this hotel for some days. The single room had no window! Outside our room there was a mosque (very noisy very, very early in the morning!!)- The staff was not very friendly or helpfull. Yes, the rooms had A/C but the corridor and the lift were hot!"
524,"this hotel was good value, not luxurious but good size room, good shower room, nice and clean, clean sheets and towels, attatched to chor bizzarre restaurant which is very nice."
525,"I got a a windowless room, which is the dirtiest hotel room I've ever received. With a cockroach, previous guests hair, dust, and so on. The bed was very hard and the door had a huge gap under neath."
526,"When we arrived at the Broadway early in the morning we were shown to room 26. This room had clean beds and clean bathroom facilities with reasonable aircon. The restaurant was good, always busy, you need to book yourself a table."
527,"Breakfast was less than desirable, the restaurant was dark and gloomy with a buffet that was questionably fresh. The hotel room was clean, but given the conditions of the room next door (two feet from our beds) I would not pay US$100 for this room."
528,"Stayed at the Broadway hotel for two nights on arriving in Delhi, after reading good reports about it in the Lonely Planet guide. Its very close to the Red Fort, and Chandni Chowk ( a maze of narrow streets and alleyways full of shops and Indian life.)"
529,Not a bad hotel in the national capital. Rooms are more or less well maintained and well furnished. Food is good and enough choices.Location is probably out of the way.
530,Hotel C Park Inn has become a home for me in delhi. Manager Mr.Udham Singh is very kind to help the guests. Hotel is simply a luxurious at a reasonably economical price.
531,"Despite of several inconveniences during my stay here (no toilet paper in my room, no hot water in the evening unless you ask for it beforehand, air condition in room 206 is noisy) I still recommend other people to stay here. It is located very well in Karol Bagh and the services you get from the management/staff are good."
532,"I stayed at this hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. The staff was real friendly and knowledgeable. I would definitely stay here again, no question."
533,A good budget hotel. Very nice manager en staff. Are very helpfull. Shops are close and also the metro station. You can book your trips in the hotel.
534,"The C Park Inn is one of the best hotels in Karol Bagh, Delhi. The rooms are clean &amp; comfortable. The staff is very frienbdly helpful. And you can't beat the price."
535,"This hotel is clean and comfortable, with good facilities and helpful staff. I have been travelling in India, visiting various cities, and my experience of staying here was far better than in some other places."
536,"Best thing about this hotel is the nice cheap currys, the friendly staff the giantic beds and they offer cable which has a few english speaking channels. Location is not too bad either everything u need is reachable which a short walk."
537,"The hotel is filthy, the staff are all dishonest. The Manager is even worse than the staff, I am used to travelling in India, but this hotel and any in its group are to be avoided."
538,"Do not let the reception fool you, we got a warm welcome but it went downhill from there. The room was dirty and smelly. We got ripped off due to taking the services offered by the hotel. One time we got food from the hotel we couldnt eat it as it wasnt cooked right."
539,"The bathroom was a disaster. The basin was broken, the water was so strange that you couldn't use it for brushing your teeth. The only towel I got during the whole stay was dirty and had some stains from someone who was spitting pan in it. The food was like the street food 20 Rps which you can get everywhere in Delhi but here you will be at least 100 Rps."
540,"We stayed there for 3 nights in January. It was by far the worst and most expensive room we had in our holidays. At the checkout they cheated with the account. So, just stay away from this [--] hole and look in Lonely Planetfor decent rooms."
541,"Dark dingy room with leaking toilet, wierd unfriendly service, yellow dirty cold. Stayed only one night thankfully, was worst night of 4month trip. Place accross the 'street' is a falling down firework factory...take care!"
542,"Dirtiest and filthy place we had ever stayed, expected better in the capital, Holes in the wall with area around the Air conditioner open, noise, cold air and polltuion of delhi can be well savoured here."
543,Good Hotel!It was great. We had a clean comfortable room. Checkin &amp; Checkout service was great&amp; quick.
544,No airport pick up unless advance payment...reservation didnot mean anything......endup picking up taxi (300rs for two)salty running water and it is yellow (non filtered from river yamuna)resturent will bring food from outside and charge guest triple price.
545,It was a bit quite.Good Security!Room and bathroom were clean.Bed was so comfortable.Everything was Good.It was quite.
546,"I stayed for one night here and found it fine. Nice staff, good location, my ride to the airport came quickly and was resonably priced, the phone worked, as did everything else in the room. I would stay here again but next time I go to India I will be on a tighter budget and this will be a little over."
547,"Terrible location. Very dirty. Broken toilet, broken and filthy fridge, and broken air conditioner. Rooms smelled like dead fish. Don't even think of a good nights rest here."
548,I stayed three days in this hotel and found that this place was remarkable with best staff. This hotel consulted me a tour which was great recomended by Raman who runs Akshat Tours and Travel.
549,"Having already booked with Expedia, I was expecting worse. However, I had only paid the minimum rate for a room. There was no hot water, the room was dirty (but not crawling!), and many fittings were broken."
550,"Hotel is currently undergoing building work and together with hotel being built next door means there is constant drilling, welding and hammering from early am til late at night. The food was okay and the staffwere nice enough but if you need some sleep, forget it."
551,I stayed in Hotel Chand Palace 2 nights and i was very happy to know this hotel where the employees are very kindly with guests and i will recommend this hotel to my friends.
552,The hotel is amazing n i m impressed by d management of staff. Food quality is too good..the hotel is well built n neat.
553,The rooms are big and clean. The service is absolutely fantastic. Not much of a business centre (1 computer and a fax/printer!) and not centrally located.
554,The Modern hotel is a good distance out of the city but the Metro link nearby is good. The Cafe 24 restaurant was quite good and I found the breakfast very satisfactory. The Bar was quiet and nice for a quiet drink in the evening.
555,"In the middle of nowhere. 45mins into delhi town, just feels like a lifetime with the taxi drivers. American breakfast!!!!!!! Have I got it wrong, do Americans now have curry and ommlette for breakfast.?"
556,"The place is lovely, the staf are great and the food fantastic but expensive. The only other issue was the expensive internet connection."
557,"City Park is a modern 7-storey hotel on the northern edge of Delhi. It is easily up to 4* European standards, close to 5*. Rooms are very large, the beds soft, the aircon quiet and the bathrooms well equipped."
558,"Clean rooms, seemed far from the city, decent breakfast and good gym (for India). Basic business hotel. We stayed there 3 times over 3 weeks and each time the Internet was down which was pretty annoying."
559,"We stayed for one night at this hotel on the first leg of the Golden Triangle tour. The food was very nice, though terribly expensive even by London standards. The biggest problem we had was that of sleep (or lack of)"
560,"The hotel is so far out of the city centre that it is difficult to use as a base for your own sightseeing. Most of the guests seemed to be on tours and they only stay here briefly. The coffee shop downstairs was a pleasant place for breakfast, plenty of choice."
561,"This was part of the Golden Triangle Trip (so Hotels booked for us) There is a slum just next to it (with, we were told, Bangladesh refugees) with sludge/sewage/junk on the pavement."
562,"The City Park is totally remote, far from anything and the former mall next door is empty except for a cookie store and an optical shop. Dogs barked tor hours in the night. The staff was rude and inefficient. The breakfast was tourist oriented and the service was slow."
563,"This hotel was arranged for us as part of a tour so we didn't have any choice in where we stayed, but we weren't disappointed. The hotel was clean, comfortable and had the best bed out of the 5 hotels we stayed in during our 2 week trip."
564,We stayed at City park as part of a tour around india. The rooms were big with all modern ammenities. The manager was very friendly and made sure we had a good time.
565,"A 4 star hotel having all the 5star facilities and amenities at a great price,will love to stay here again on my next visit to delhi. Staff was very friendly and helpful the environment with in a hotel was gud,and food was excellent specially yellow chilli."
566,"I was booked at the Jaypee Siddarth; however, despite having a confirmed reservation, I was rebooked at the City Park Hotel. While it is not the most centrally located, the rooms are clean and the customer service is exceptional."
567,"The City Park is a 4 star hotel with 0 star customer care standards. We were pleasantly surprised upon arrival as the lobby and surrounding areas looked welcoming, spacious and well laid out. The staff at check in were cordial rather than friendly."
568,The hotel derives its name from a city park directly opposite. The aruvedic massages are cheaper then in Kerala with a one hour massage for 600 inr plus tax.
569,"Front desk staff were very good, the food was good (breakfast was fair, but the dinners were excellent), and the room was clean. Laundry service was prompt and very good as well. It is just not in a very good location."
570,This hotel is located in a North Delhi residential area while most of Delhi's other good hotels are located in posh south delhi localities. There is absolutely no attraction around this hotel. The only place which is closeby (relatively only) is some of the Old Delhi attractions about 12-15Kms from this place.
571,"we stayed here as the 1st night of our golden triangle tour. it wasthe best of the 3 hotels we stayed at - very clean, good rooms, and good service. breakfast was not so good but we got much more than we expected."
572,"The rooms are clean, are well decorated and a good size. The restaurant was excellent and probably one of the best we ate at in India!! There is also the usual facilities at the hotel, Gym, swimming pool, 24hr room service."
573,"All staff were atttentive but held out their hands to make their wages, not tips. One would bring 1 towel, get a tip and return with a helper and another towel and want more money for his return PLUS his mate. Then flowers, then soap, then more bottled water at US$4 per bottle."
574,i was at Clark heights to meet my girl friend came from Dubai. First i was very hazy about where she is staying. After reaching there we have found that safe and nice pl;ace in the main city.
575,"The rooms in this hotel were adequate though super super deluxe. Not great value for money and very noisy due to construction work and the busy road outside. Staff on reception were nice and friendly, with the exception of the travel agent who charged extortionate prices for hiring hotel taxis."
576,"Rooms were ok, but everything else was terrible about this place. Staff changed their pricing on us many times (and of course, they over charged us). They don't have a restuarant although they say they do."
577,We booked 10 rooms for the marriage purpose for three nights stay. Hotel staff was very helpful speciall the lady at reservation helped us alot in arranging the batchlores party at the basement.
578,We stayed at Clark Heights for 5 days in November. Some of the staff were very nice but we were charged extortionaly for organising taxis with the hotel. Service charge on train tickets were high. Recommend to get Rickshaws than use their taxis.
579,"The hotel is currently undergoing building works so you are staying on a construction site. The reception staff were helpful, except for the woman who arranged our trip to Agra and Amritsar. All in all, we weren't very impressed with this hotel."
580,Paying more money than the nearly hotels we expected more standard butthere was seepage in our rooms and it was smelling. We do notunderstand as to then give the room to customers.
581,I book room from internet. No pick up and no refund. 80 Kms. small taxi for 15 Rs. 1 km. High price hotel/ guest house.
582,"Friendly staff an ok restaurant with cheap food. The hotel has a nice location - yes, there is noise from the streets - but nothing you couldn`t live with."
583,I was there in months of september with my father. I found very helpful and caring people and they helped me in my further tour as well and very well organized by the hotel staff. The rooms are very nice and specious I love to give **** star for this hotel.
584,as i wnt to d hotel i was really impresd by the intrir.................the staff was really good and coperative..............i enjoyed hotel.........the food i had there was delisious.......
585,"The hotel was clean, room mid size. No pick up at the airport. Very noisy all night. Staff was nice location was ok; we prepaid 250 IR for a car taxi from airport."
586,The experience at clark was better than any five star hotel I v stayed in. The rooms are way bigger n nicer than most. The food was divine. All my out of town tours to Amritsar n Agra were very well arranged.
587,I arrived in Nov in Delhi with my family. We booked hotel clarck online because it was easy. As expected we were picked up at the airport. The rooms were not as nice as the photos online.
588,"I booked this hotel on a friend’s recommendation and after looking the reviews on trip advisor. The staff is just eager to sell you tour to Agra and Jaipur. There ware small insects in the room, the bathroom has a foul smell. Charge is quit high compared to the services."
589,"I enjoyed a great 2-days stay over there with my colleagues. The interior of the hotel is very impressive and I must give a special compliment 2 the hotel staff too. The service is really upto the mark and moreover, what I liked the most is its location."
590,"Good value for money. Staff was courteous , freindly and very helpful. Rooms were nicely done and clean. The late night coffe shop was a blessing for us due to late night at wedding function."
591,"I stayed their for 2 nights and 3 days. I must say its the best place have never been. Infrastructure is beautifully designed, internet facilities provided by the hotel was the best the speed was good."
592,I booked this hotel from internet as the hotel fails to pickup me from airport even the service at night was not good. Many time you think for the best but you get nothing and you get bad experience.
593,"Hotel Clark Heights was a wonderful experience. Room was immaculately clean, the bedding and pillows were heavenly. All staff went out to be helpful and pleasant."
594,"Clark Heights hotel is in a crowded road, but accessible to the mero which is about a km away in walking. The double delux room is a bit small, but we found it quiet, as it was the corner room for us. The menu is mostly North Indian food with some Chinese and Continental options."
595,"This is decent hotel if you want to live around patel nagar, but it is on a very busy intersection. Do not book room by metra side, or you will not be able to sleep. Hotel staff was very good."
596,First time in India and after a poor night in Mumbai I was pleasantly surprised by the Clark Heights hotel. Convenient to the Delhi Metro I found no difficulty getting around.
597,"The rooms were dull and not clean (a thick layer of dust covered mostof the furniture); the bathroom consisted of a shower, an overflowingtoilet and a bucket; the ceiling was covered with small flies; thehotel was noisy (children running around and constant unidentifieddripping in each room during the whole night)"
598,This hotel is very old and run down. In the room the ceiling fan is too loud to run and to turn off the lamp next to the bed you have to unscrew the bulb. The fuzzy TV works but the remote doesn't .... I hope you are getting the picture.
599,"i been to this hotel in this month only, and find it worth it for money, check-in take just 3-4min to get our rooms, housekeeping manager is really helpful, all the staff members are really nice n helping. Even there travel desk is very helpful for us.Awesome nad enjoyable trip!!!! gr8t memories."
600,"The hotel is located in a very busy, noisy and rowdy area. However, the staff are curteous and always at one's service. The rooms are neat, the food is satisfactory."
601,"The hotel is well positioned, the staff are very friendly and fell over themselves to organise trips for us. Rafiq Khan who operates through the hotel for Indian Tribal Tours arranged for us to have a driver for the say."
602,The air con make so much noise that you can’t even get a nap for 5minutes not recommended. Room is ok but all fixtures are old.
603,A normal hotel which is on the road with lot of traffic noise allnight. They took $70 from me which is overpriced for the service and the kind of room given to me. I got amuch better quality and service at 40$.
604,The hotel arranged to meet &amp; collect us from New Delhi Railway station at 6.30am. The included breakfast was very good. I would highly recomment this place for anyone passing through Delhi.
605,This hotel is in a very busy are. There are many hotels nearly. Therecharges are higher and services are not at all good. We checked out ofthe hotel next morning and the reception took 30 minutes to check usout.
606,"This hotel has its reception area open to a very undesirable tour operator. He was present in the hotel lobby bothering the tourists on all 3 days we where there. Despite this negative first impression, the food was great as was its price, service could be better. Air conditioning was not working in our room and it took over 2 hrs to relocate us."
607,"Rooms are on the dark side but they are clean and comfortable with satelite TV, Air Con and a Fan. Hot water only worked in the morning. I like the neighborhood of Karol Bagh."
608,"Clark hotel is located in a busy street, But was realy surperised once we enter. Staff was realY helpful, free breakfast and free pick up from airport is really a big advantage. Will visit again in november, thanks to there hospitality."
609,"Me my wife stayed here for a good 3 days good. Rooms were not that bad but not that good too. Breakfast was average. High price for hotel like this, they have arrangement with bad travel agents."
610,"Our travel agent booked this hotel for 1 night but we arrived very late at night there and ended up to book 1 more night directly at the front desk who were very polite,gentle and helpfull always. The service is ok most of the time we had our meals on the rooftop restaurant with quality dishes."
611,Airport pick was very helpful. Little expansive but Delhi's hotels are expansive compare to other cities. Use travel sites to get good deal.
612,The hotel is situated right in the heart of the Karol Bagh district of New Delhi- a fantastic place to get a feel for real street life. The rooftop restaurant served excellent breakfasts (recommended the on-demand omelettes and coffee)
613,"I booked an executive room in this hotel for a one night stay, which included an airport pickup. The room was clean (though small in size) including the linen. The staff were friendly and all queries were looked ater. And yes the bed is amazing!"
614,"i stay 3 nights and person of the hotel was very nice , and the rooms are very clean , food good too... The travel desk of the Hotel very helpful &amp; friendly Mr. Rafiq and Mr. Haroon."
615,The staff at the front desk were really helpful and gave great directions to the various places I wanted to go to. I was also pleasantly surprised by the open rooftop breakfast area/restaurant.
616,"Fab hotel - possibly a bit pricier than some in Delhi - £30 a night. Very comfortable, great food, but mostly, excellent service and friendly."
617,"The hotel is lovely inside, the room was spacious, the A/C worked, the restaurant was pleasant and the staff were more than helpful. The bathroom was somewhat grubby but that is a recurrent problem throughout India. Karol Bagh isn't a clean, Westernised area like the areas that house some of the 5 star hotels."
618,"Great little hotel which has great value. Breakfast is included in the price and is very good. We had food in the restaurant one evening and despite being the only ones there, the food was very good!"
619,"The hotel represents excellent value at around 20 pounds per night. If you are used to 3 star European hotels you may be a little disappointed with the first impression, but things are different in India."
620,Stayed at the hotel with wife and 3 year old and got a king size bed as asked for. Room was a decent size and quality was ok without being extraordinary. For food we ate at Pizza Hut round the corner but beware of taxi drivers in the area.
621,"We booked our stay at Hotel Clark International before we left home. The drawbacks were that there was construction happening on the rooftop which woke us up in the a.m., they tried to charge us for items n the fridge we didn't drink, and phone calls were pricey."
622,"We booked (and prepaid) via Expedia a premium room. The bed was awesomely comfortable, the room, (on the 3rd floor) was clean, neat and modern. Watch out for the high alcholic content of the Kingfisher beer however!"
623,"I booked the Hotel for a stopover before my international flight. The room was nice and clean, but the bathroom although clean was a bit run down. The food at the restaurant was ok and the breakfast, although simple, was ok too."
624,"Staff were always welcoming and there was a real sense of safety. Breakfast is served in the rooftop restaurant and is included in the price. The hotel is situated in a busy shopping area with coffee shops, Pizza Hut and McDonalds nearby."
625,"I had a few occasions to stay at the hotel once in sept 2008 and once more in nov 2008. The things i really liked : room ambience, room cleanliness, hospitable staff, top floor open air restaurant, proximity to market place and metro station, food(taste). the let downs: room service - sometimes took ages, food was little spicy, lack of variety in food choices, AC- almost non functional, room size, tv(still CRT) in some rooms."
626,Theed in a great spot right close to the Coroba market. Free WiFi and a conference room where we were abl eto use it all day for interviewing stayy.
627,"Mrs. Bhattacharyyaapr1_63@hotmail.com stayed at Hotel Clark International at the at the beginning, middle and end of our trip at New Delhi. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel especially because of the very friendly, accomodating and warm behaviour of the Hotel Staff."
628,"Hotel failed to pick us up at the airport when we arrived at 6.15 AM, but claimed that the hotel boy had been there and that we just hadent spotted him. Hotel was definately the most expensive we stayed in during our 16-day India tour."
629,"I booked the Hotel Clark International directly via their website. The hotel requested my credit card information for a confirmed reservation. When we arrived in Delhi from the airport at 1:30 am we were told the hotel did not have a room for us, the hotel was fully booked. The Hotel Surya was awful... We were so tired from the flight and it was in the middle of the night we just slept in the room in our sleep sacks. I could not recommend them due to this poor customer service."
630,"We spent 5 nights in total over 2 different periods at the hotel. We stayed in an Executive room though we were upgraded free of charge to a Premium room for one night. We paid £86 per night for the Executive room. This includes airport pick up, breakfast and complimentary wi-fi. The room was of reasonable size and very clean."
631,"The so called romantic roof terrace restaurant did not serve wine. The roof of same is lined with bamboo, above which numerous pigeons reside. Only one of our party was sick over a five day period."
632,"Our room was very small with a heater and A/C unit that looked like they were made 50 years ago. Staff were not friendly but capable enough. They organised a free pick up from the airport, but this was a dusty 15 year old tiny car."
633,"Hotel is located in the quiet street of Karol Bagh, 5 minutes walk from metro. Hot water was in fact just warm, so shower in the morning was challenging. Electricity outlets were so outdated that small plugs (cell or photo charger) required support to stay plugged."
634,I stayed at this hotel on the 19th Dec for 2 nights and we had booked 2 rooms. We got complimentary airport pick up which was great. The location is great for all the tourist sights.
635,"Hotel is situated in one of the best areas in Delhi, which is Karol Bagh. Staff are very helpful, and polite. The food from the roof top restaurant is pretty decent and poison free."
636,"Hotel is a bit dated, and shows it in places. The one big negative point was the aircon unit just above our heads over the bed. Otherwise the food and drinks are decent and reasonably priced."
637,"It was really a good experience with my partener to stay in this hotel, the pick up was free and efficient as we arrive delhi mid night The hotel was good and clean, Hope fully i get what i pay."
638,"excellent quality accommodation for the value in delhi. karol bagh is a hustling area, but nice to have a quiet hotel... very friendly and helpful staff!!"
639,"The room was of a relatively nice size. However the room I stayed in would have gotten a 1 star anywhere else. There were very big cracks in the walls, the room was dirty. The airconditioning unit was very grimy, the bathroom was very shabby."
640,"The hotel is well priced, conveniently located near the Metro line (Karol Bag stop), provides airport pickup and drop off. Front desk staff are helpful and friendly, food in the restaurant is convenient and tasty. A travel service is available in the lobby which can arrange a driver and tours of the city."
641,"We regularly stay at this hotel. On a budget this hotel is great value. The staff is very accomodating, in particular Rajesh and Ekta on the front desk."
642,"Hotel Clark International in Delhi was booked through Expedia. As part of our booking, we had requested the free airport pickup to the hotel. We received our confirmation and were looking forward to our stay. However, on arrival at Delhi International Airport, there was no one from the hotel to pick us up."
643,"Hotel Clark isn't the most luxurious hotel in town, but it provides good facilities in a lively part of town. Dinner and beer in the rooftop restaurant good and reasonably priced too."
644,"Hotel is located in Karol Bagh and is right in the heart of things,clustered with back street markets and is extremely lively. Yes, the area is not the cleanest, but 75% of Delhi is like this. The food in the roof top resurant is excellent and the staff really friendly."
645,"The rooms on the fourth floor are very nice. Spotless, crispy white sheets, a clean modern bathroom. Breakfast is good, the view outside is great."
646,"Check-in was anything but smooth. Front-desk was insistent to have 600 INR/night for extra bed. Bathroom standard should have been better. TV was not working, there is only 2-3 channels tuned in."
647,"I have been to Delhi 4 times in the past two years due to my hubby working out there. This time we were on holiday, I booked the Clark International via there web site which was so easy. We arrived in Delhi late at night, the hotel car picked us up from the airport. When we arrived at the Clark I nearly called a taxi to take us to the Imperial Hotel."
648,"Clean, smallish but well-kept room (with noisy a/c) friendly and helpful staff. The area is noisy and colorful, which we rather enjoyed."
649,My brother and I were returning to India after many many years to discover the origins of our parents. I was born in Devlali and left as a baby. It was therefore important that we had good accommodation in Mumbai and Delhi. And certainly the Clark gave us this.
650,"Bed ok, bathroom passable, meals passable general staff attitude ok. The major problem this hotel has is their association with Abyss Travel...they are a joke, so see through makes you laugh. All the old tricks...obvious plants lies, lies lies."
651,"My room was small but clean and comfortable. The staff were all very kind. I could walk to all sorts of shopping and the hotel has easy access to taxis, etc."
652,The hotel is in the heart of new delhi in a non-touristy area. Free breakfast buffet was great with a mix of local and american food.
653,"Clean, friendly hotel with all mod cons (inc wi fi) in a busy - though not exactly central - part of town. By Indian standards it's very fairly priced too, so book well in advance."
654,"Hotel is located in a busy market area. The street noise could definitely be heard in the hotel rooms. They have a cute roof top restaurant. Good Indian, Western and Chinese food."
655,"Efficient, good value hotel. Reception staff not particularly helpful or friendly but efficient. Included breakfast was good, and Nepali &quot;head&quot.; waiter very friendly. Evening meal good value and good. Room was clean, quiet and secure."
656,"Stayed on two occasions in Jan. One night at first then 3 nights after a 6 day train journey. The rooms were clean,the bathrooms had bath, shower, all very clean, mini-bar &amp; air con,TV and free internet connection. There was some traffic noise but unavoidable in such a busy city."
657,"Hotel was spotlessly cleaned each day, bed linen was changed daily, hot water was plentiful. Restaurant facilities and breakfast was very good. Only downside was that the location was a little rough."
658,"The Clark Hotel was clean and comfortable. The staff was very helpful, but not all spoke good English. The morning breakfast buffet was good, with toast available for picky eaters (like my children)"
659,"We stayed at the Clark after staying at a couple of similar hotels which were 'nasty' Don't have any doubts about staying there the place is very clean and the food brilliant,staff could'nt be more helpful."
660,"We were on the 2nd floor and we could hear the vehicles passing by, horns beeping, people's voices, et al. Not very comfortable when all you need is a good night's sleep. We had a portable heater in our room and it wasn't working, so we phoned the reception to replace it. They did...with another non-working unit."
661,"Good hotel in Delhi, offered free airport pickup. Great breakfast included in room price. Room had a modern feel and was well-appointed."
662,"My friend and I stayed here in September, the only fault was they we're revamping the reception which was transformed in the space of 24hrs - no mucking about! And it really didn't affect us just added to the adventures of India."
663,"I would recommend this place ONLY to budget travellers. Some people were helpful, others were downright rude. The hotel travel agent is dodgy and tried to make me go to Kashmir."
664,"Hotel has all European amenities, a huge double bed and a 32&quot; flat screen TV. The food in the restaurant on the roof is amazing, we had a tandoori platter for rs350."
665,The Clark is a quiet spot and very western in all its amenities. The rooms were large with high ceilings and the latest in equipment and bathroom convenience... we had everything down to the bathroom slippers.
666,"Great Hotel, the staff were fantastic and helpful always. After you get over the initial shock of the driving, poverty and the streets you will grow to love this little gem of a hotel. The hotel is literally a 30 second walk from Karol Bagh market which is great fun."
667,"The rooftop restaurant is very good, the food is excellent and although the hotel does not have a bar you can get a beer with your meal. Breakfast is decidedly Indian with not very much concession to European taste."
668,"Very clean and functional room (401), helpful staff. They agreed without problem to replace the free airport pickup which we didn't need by an airport drop-off early morning."
669,"The hotel is located in Asia's biggest shopping area, Karol Bagh. The ultra-modern Delhi Metro station is 5 minutes from the hotel. Breakfast on the rooftop is very pleasant."
670,"stayed in this hotel 3 nights Oct 07. transfer from airport good as we were 90 mins late the driver waited for us..our room was dissapointing ,room 407. no view blacked out widow ( a concrete wall behind) I guess it was quiet apart form hearing the lift go up and down all night. Roof top restaurant average lacked a few green plants lots of bird poo on the edges of the terrace, but delhi is delhi."
671,"We booked through Otel.com, and paid online for an Executive room, one up from the normal room type. When we checked in we got given the most basic crummy room, which had been painted that morning. Lots of renovation going on, but they did give us some free meals at the hotel restaurant."
672,"Hotel was ok, was being decorated so constant smell of turps. No window which I found a bit weird. Breakfast was good on top floor restaurant, staff generally helpful."
673,Booked via Expedia 3 weeks prior to stay. Included in room price ($100 AUD) was airport pick-up. On arrival day had to email hotel to make sure they were going to pick us up.
674,"We opted for the most expensive room on the property, which was around US$125 per night. The food is rather good and the rooftop restaurant is charming. Overall good value for the money but probably won't stay there again."
675,"I booked on expedia.com, choosing by price ($110), thinking there are a slew of hotels in the $30 range and this would fit right in the middle. It is not near a 4 Star hotel, but what in India would be called a 3 star. Rooms are noisy, &quot;India Clean&quot;"" and not worth more than $40."
676,The hotel was definitely dedicated to taking care of their guests. I completely forgot that I was alone in a strange land very far away from home. All recommendations of hotels throughout the tour were superb.
677,"We stayed at this hotel for two days and here's why I liked it. The staff is very courteous and helpful. The rooms are clean and when you request extra towels or sheets, they are provided promptly."
678,Clark Intl. based on reviews on TripAdvisor. We had a delightful stay and were very pleased with the hotel staff. Our room was basic but both the room and the hotel inside was very clean.
679,"The hotel is centrally located in the Karol bagh area and close to Metro station. The facilities are clean and maintained reasonaby well . The complementary breakfast is good . The negatives - the surrounding areas are not too good , but you cannot have a central location and peace together."
680,"The Clark International is a short walk from the efficient New Delhi Metro. The hotel was able to accommodate us immediately, which after a long journey was greatly appreciated."
681,I picked the Clark based on reviews on Trip Advisor. The staff recommended a travel company nearby to rent a car &amp; driver for a day. There is some shopping not too far away from the hotel. Will definitely stay again.
682,"In general, Delhi is a shaddy place, full of touts and scammers. Do not trust the hotel tour guide! He lied about the seat availabilty, luring us to his expensive car rides."
683,We booked three rooms in advance for the Clark International. On arrival we discovered that the hotel had over-booked itself. The rooms were dull and not clean (a thick layer of dust covered most of the furniture)
684,Francoise Wang-Toutain. french nationality the location of the hotel is very convenient. Delhi metro station is a 5 minutes (may be 3) walk and the metro goes directly to Connaught place. The food is very clean and delicious (I mean for a foreigner like me) the room are comfortable (though I had not the most comfortable one). The cleaning is done correctly everyday. the internet is free access.
685,"I stayed at that place twice, with quick and friendly check in. Rooms on both occations were small but rather clean. Bathrooms came with working but primitive showers and toilets. Good towels provided and they even had toiletries."
686,"Hotel Clark International is on a narrow side street in an older part of Bangalore. The dining room is on the top-5th- floor, but the very old elevator only goes to the fourth floor. The buffet breakfast was fine; omelettes could be cooked to order."
687,Great hotel - very basic but great service. The hotel was a bit noisy between 7am- 7pm because of the market. You felt like you were in India and not a sterile 5* hotel.
688,Clark International is a fine hotel. Our rooms were clean. The room service was quick and food very good. All of the staff were very pleasant. The hotel took care of all our transportation and tour arrangements.
689,"The hotel is located in the odd shopping district of Delhi with small streets and shops. Be prepared for noise, dust, disorganised telephone lines, stray dogs and dilapidated store fronts."
690,"Peter Goh stayed at Hotel Clark International, New Delhi, India. Hotel is three star amenities but has some five star facilities. Food was really good,bit spicy but i like. Staff was very friendly."
691,The hotel is just a five minute walk from Delhi's new Metro system. Staff were efficient at arranging taxis and giving advice on other transport/tourist issues. Hard to blame the hotel for this but worth pointing out.
692,"First-timers in India, especially travellers from Europe and the US should know that India is very different place from home. The traffic is very busy, all cars scratched and those people horn vigorously. The hotel itself is OK, reasonably clean and the staff was friendly."
693,"Staff - Extremely friendly, cooperative and supportive.Infrastructure - excellent.Location - centrally located. good for shopping. metro station is close by."
694,We stayed at Clark for 4 days. Bookings were arranged directly with the hotel. Staff very helpful and check in/out was very smooth. The rooftop restaurant lacks ambience but worth a visit.
695,"The hotel was good , Rooms were clean with clean cloth covers. Over all nice stay as it was only one night. The hotel wasGood, Rooms wereClean with cleancloth covers, Over allNice Stay as It was only One night."
696,I had a nice stay in the hotel with my wife. A homly &amp; clean environment with prompt service was great . value for the money.
697,"Ok hotel if you need somewhere to crash, not near anything useful except the metro and markets. Staff were helpful, area was dodgy."
698,I was confirming at hotel classic. Room service was good if you put some money for the house keeping. Price they charge for the rooms are again too high for what you want to get. Management should be ashamed of them.
699,We travelled Delhi in group tour of India of Delhi Agra Jaipur Jaiselmer. We were served well by smiling staff. Hotel is near metro station will lift which in useful for old person like us.
700,Hotel Classic is Classic in all means. I was planning to cancel my trip to India due to disturbances in India but Owner Jitendra Chadda assured that he will take care of us. Pickup person was always smiling (I was very annoyed with Cusom person at Airport) but he took care of our luggage.
701,I have been visiting India's cities for last 2Months. This hotel has been most comfortable and memorable experience. Service was good. Hot showers worked early morning (Surprising in Indian Cities). Even breakfast was served at 5AM on my request.
702,I booked the hotel on internet after seeing good reviews but on my arrival uncleaned room given to me but when i request the front desk they tell me to wait for 2 hours. Over all experience was bad the room service was not good. The front manager was polite and good but service was zero.
703,"Hotel is in the middle of a slightly quieter surburban district and is only a 5 minute walk to the nearest metro station. Staff are helpful and the service great, with room service at pretty much any time of night or day."
704,Good Clean Budget Hotel in Market Area Koral Bugh. We had beed reffered by friends who visited last year. It was very nice experience. Staff very friendly.
705,Hotel was clean comfortable beds and occationally hot water. Breakfast was in our room as there is no dining room. The area of the hotel did not make us feel afraid to walk out in the evening.
706,Hotel was refered to us through common friend. We were picked up from Airport on request to hotel and were given room on 3rd floor as requested in mail. Nearby Mcdonald was a blessing for us.
707,No breakfast is included and to be honest I'd really have my doubts on the standard of hygiene in food preperation...therefore we did not call for any room service. Its not a cheap hotel and better can be found for the price in this area.
708,The location is very convenient for the metro - a 5 minute walk down a busy shopping street brings you to the hustle and bustle of the road where the metro station is. There's an internet terminal in the lobby and wi-fi.
709,"The rooms look pretty tired, tv had poor reception and no complimentary breakfast. The location is fairly central and close to the metro that's about it. For IRs 2811 (approximately US $60.00) we expect clean sheets."
710,"Karol Bagh is a very safe and friendly part of the city. The hotel itself was clean and functional, nothing flash. From here you can see the city easily and inexpensively."
711,"There is nothing really wrong with this hotel but you can do better for the price. Staff were fine - although sent me to get ripped off when buying a SIM card from their friend. They charge 900 INR, when you can get there easily for 300 INR."
712,"The hotel has a very small lobby. The only seating area is next to the reception desk, practically blocking the main thoroughfare. Not at all comfortable and not appropriate for any more than 5-10 min use."
713,Very Clean Hotel in Busting Delhi. Very Cheap and found same as given in reviws. Staff help to guide you for city vision and Jaipur. Provided hot B;fast in Room very early morning.
714,This is Nice Hotel in Market Place Koral Baugh. Hotel was extremely clean. Staff was very cheerful and replied to my queries about Agra. We will visit again on our return trip.
715,Great Great Great. Our Start of Tour has been Excellent. We booked this hotel by watching reviews of this hotel. I requested Airport pickup at midnight and hotel offered pickup for US$20 instead of US$25.
716,"Rooms were quite good, clean and not noisy.Staff was nice, spoke good english and helped me whenever i asked for.Hotel is 5 min walking from metro station."
717,Our Uncle Booked 2 Rooms for us in this hotel. Pickup was excellent in Big Cab with one of hotel person standing with placard at morning odd hours. Rooms were very comfortable.
718,The Hotel Classic is an average mid-range hotel in the bustling Karol Bagh district. The room service menu (including breakfast) is very cheap for basic but tasty food. The hotel can arrange reasonably priced transfers and pick-ups to the airport and train station.
719,"Classic was our first impression of India...and the staff there was friendly, warm and welcoming. The hotel was very inexpensive by my travel standards as I am used to paying $100 to $200 per night."
720,"great location, near the metro station. the room is clean and the hotel staff are very helpful. train,flight reservation can be made thru this hotel. You can chat and get informations online from the staff."
721,"This is an inexpensive hotel in a very crowded neighborhood that will probably be very foreign and confusing to most westerners. Furniture is acceptable, the bed is quite comfortable, and while nothing about the room is spectacular, it is acceptable. I would advise staying at a Western hotel for a couple of days upon arrival to acclimate to India."
722,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our holiday in India. The suite was large, clean and quiet. Staff were courteous, obliging and quietly efficient."
723,"Hotel has the best service you could want. Made us feel right at home, and went out of their way to supply all our needs. All of the staff made us feel comfortable and were very respectful."
724,"Very cool place, peaceful and stylish. Good service and not that expensive though not sure how much we paid. Not the best value for money we have had but worth spending up for."
725,I am still staying in this hotel. Extreeeeemly clean :-). Loved thy are treating us. Staff here is attentive to our calls and swing into action whenever required. Location is wonderfull- in busy busy market. Pollution -Key factor Govt should look into.
726,"Hotel in Karol Bagh has a roof terrace for sitting out. Staff were helpful and friendly. Room was extremely clean, cosy, quiet and had everything one might need."
727,"ideally located,excellent service ,warm staff and i always make my customers stay there and all appreciate the hotel. The hotel is located in the heart of the city."
728,I chose this hotel after reading a few comments here. They were mostly right. This hotel is really OK nothing exciting but clean and the stuff was very friendly and helpful. No dining hall tho so you have to ask for your breakfast to delivered to your room!
729,"We were looking for a hotel in a good location with a reasonable price. This was definitely not one of them. If anything, it was worth much less than the $50 a night we paid."
730,"The building is fairly old, the elevator tiny, the room old fashioned. They use a good local restaurant and don't have their own kitchen or dining room. Do contact the hotel directly for their airport pick-up service."
731,"After reading positive reviews on this site, I've decided to book a 4 night stay at this hotel. What a mistake! It seems that there is no logical explanation for the good reviews, except... There is a big sign in the front lobby and in the elevator, saying &quot;Post a good review about us on tripadvisor.com and you can win 2 nights free stay. I have personally seen 5 different rooms in the hotel, and they all were horrible. But, that will come later."
732,"Above average compared to other New Delhi moderately priced hotels. Everything worked; A/C, TV, fan, hot water. Tip everyone that helped you during your stay on the way out."
733,This was a good hotel (with air conditioning and a back up generator) Delhi can be quite a shock to the system but this was a nice oasis. The rooms were clean and the front desk staff spoke English.
734,"This is a decent hotel in the heart of the shopping district. For the price, it's about the best you can find in Delhi. Also walking distance (about 3 blocks) to a GREAT restuarant -- Udupi."
735,Hotel is hidden just off the road in the middle of nowhere. Bathroom had basic features...strong water pressure but hardly any hot water. Breakfast was very dissapointing.
736,"This Dee marks hotel was selected by me &amp; my friends on certain aspects, like reasonable rate package. As this hotel had given a good security but as compared to the rooms were also reasonably ok. On comparison with other hotels price it was quite reasonable, as it was other part that they didn't provide me those things."
737,"Overall the hotel is good, the rooms are clean, spacious, value for money. They have individual air-con, a good TV, and the bed is comfy. But it is let down by petty things, namely associated with the staff."
738,"i tried to book in to a 5* hotel as usual, however at such short notice was imposible. i booked the super deluxe suite with them on the phone at a price of £550 for 5 nights. when i arrived at the hotel they charged my card, then was shown to my room. as a frequent traveller in instantly realised that this was not a suite. Once in the room, the juccuzi didnt work at all nor did any water come from the taps. i was not honoured any of the deluxe complimentary services."
739,"A new, modern hotel inside, we didn't get to see the grounds since we got there late in the day and left early in the morning. Phone in the room didn't always work when calling the reception desk, and trying to make an international call was a hassle."
740,"I was in Hotel Ajanta the sister concern of this hotel for 3 days on work. Very nice and comfortable rooms, excellent service and a great location."
741,Do not stay here. The website is misleading and the place is disgusting. There was actual blood on the walls of the bathroom and the building is literally falling apart. An absolutely disgusting experience.
742,"We arrived to be told that because we had arrived early we had to pay for almost an additional nights rate. The room whilst 'cleaned' was uncomfortable in that the sheets and towels were grey and so threadbare there were holes in them. Staff wanted money for just about everything, so much so that one actually pushed his way into the room while we were undressing to ask for money for returning the passports they took off us on reception."
743,I travelled with friends to India and stayed in new delhi at hotel delhi city center. I liked the room in the hotel. Nice and bright. The staff helped me understand where to go and what to see.
744,"I was in this awful hotel, and the staff would try to cheat you at every time. They charge things you haven't consumed, and for that price you can go to a REAL HOTEL. I hope the government would close it for obvious reasons, they cheat everytime they can."
745,"We stayed at this hotel with our 3 children in the Family room. The area around the hotel is terrible, the smell, the dirtiness as well as people ready to hassle you as soon as you stand outside. For breakfast you have to go to the Ajanta, a hotel just in front of this hotel. The staff there are not interested in service anyway. We definitely will never stay there again!"
746,"Hotel Delhi Centre has a sister hotel, The Hotel Ajanta. The photos on the website are of the Ajanta (which look quite reasonable), not the Hotel Delhi Centre."
747,"I was on a business trip to Delhi and fortunately I had the privilege to book the hotel of my choice. Unfortunately my destiny took me me to this hotel. people are really pathetic, room service guys look into your purse, as though its their birth right."
748,"Escort girl entered by the back door with her client, customer of the hotel. Though they were discreet, they were not hiding. This hotel is probably not to recommend for family."
749,The hotel is operated by the Ajanta Hotel. It had advertised being adjacent the the train station. It was not. The train station was about 5-6 blocks walk. The staff were friendly and helpful.
750,"The staff was friendly, spoke good English, and was helpful. The room was smaller than expected and not especially clean. The location is convenient, as noted by other reviews."
751,Mrs. ravi helped us plan a great trip north of delhi. The room met my expectations and the breakfast was good. The staff at this hotel makes it a great place to stay.
752,"I stayed at this hotel 2 nights, I think the location is great to go to Delhi station, metro, Connaught place. Regarding the room, it is simple - not good and not bad. I felt the price is a bit expensive with total."
753,"brand new modern hotel ,picked us up from the airport gave us a nice hot meal at 3 am at night and woke us up the next day. They dont have a seperate conceirge but hotel staff spent enuf time to answer my questions .I will be back and have recomended them to my organisation ."
754,"This is a super choice for the budget traveller, close to Connaught Place and Old Delhi. Much better than many other cheap places opposite the railway station."
755,"Great place to stay in Delhi! For the price I paid, I got exactly what I wanted - clean, comfortable and welcoming. Staff were extremely helpful and go out of their way to serve all your needs."
756,We were disappointed with this hotel. We should have researched it better. The pictures on the website are misleading. The airport pickup was a plus.
757,"Staff were very friendy, going out of there way to help us to ATMs at night (safely) and to get to and from India. The shower water pressure isn't the greatest - but that is possibly a consequence of being in India."
758,"I Booked through the website- made the most of the offers they have on it- stayed for 3 nights got one night free and also a agra trip free. Paid $45 per night though..The hotel is very comfortable compared to the hotels in that locality, seriously."
759,"We were so unhappy with this hotel, When we saw mouse in our room we all are scared and all jerk staff start smiling. Slept there one night because we had no choice. Coughed most of the night because of the smoke-embedded room. Eyes were on fire for a full 24 hours after checking out."
760,The services were good and the staff was very humble and polite and always ready to help. In all we enjoyed the trip to Delhi. I would always recomend the hotel to all my friends.
761,We stayed in the hotel for three days and we never felt that we are away from home as the staff was very soft and polite. In short we had a GREAT STAY and enjoyed a lot.
762,I travelled to delhi for business purpose and was looking for some hotel near to pahar ganj &amp; found Express 66. Hotel is quite ok with all the required infrastructure and facilities. Only thing is the location. situated on narrow road with full of traffic.
763,"stayed here for 2 nights.. good service friendly staff at front office, rooms were clean and was informed that these were recently renovated .. looked better than the ones on the website quite surprising. use of jazzy wallpaper's and wooden paneling not bad...."
764,i booked this after finding it in a search engine. and reading some favourable reviews. our 3 night stay was our final leg of a month travelling around india. it was very disappointing from the outside and i went to inspect the rooms before we unloaded the luggage as i thought it couldnt possibly be the same place. it is located on a very busy main road home to the timber and aluminuim industry which is in use 24 hours. there is no restaurant and you have to order breakfast (which was included in our package) and any other food via room service which is then brought to your room.
765,"Arrival was a shock: smog, smoke, dust, metal traiders, wires... Hotel starts from 2d floor. Nobody knows the street and the hotel. WiFi doesn't work."
766,The hotel isn't on the best street in Delhi but at least it's not in the heart of busy/noisy Paharganj. Our deal included breakfast but there is no restaurant so this had to be taken in the room. Overall we would recommend this hotel.
767,The hotel rooms are spacious &amp; elegantly designed. Everything in the room was in perfecty working condition which we didn't find in any other hotel in India. We spent three nights there without any complaints.
768,I stayed one night in Delhi and I did the choice for Express66 believing in what other reviews said about it. The room we booked it was a double twin beds and they said on arrival they only had one bed double. When I tried to turn on the light on the bed table the light wasn´t connected either. there we was surrounded by dust everywhere.
769,The hotel is in a very shabby part of the town. The room had a damp smell. The hand shower in the toilet did not work. Complaining to the manager did not working.
770,"The hotel location is not very good, but the rooms are news, comfortable and clean. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I have a great time in Express 66."
771,"The rooms are reasonably priced, clean, and well kept. A very creative and contemporary collection of art is also tastefully displayed throughout the hotel. The food was well prepared, and tasty."
772,I stayed in Express66 not once but twiceand have reservation for the third time. The rooms and bathrooms are very clean. The manager and rest of staff are helpful and their service is excellent.
773,The hotel is new and it is quite small (there are only three floors with a few rooms per floor). The rooms are very clean and the bathrooms are new. It can get a bit noisy at night if you have a room with a window towards the street.
774,"The Florence Delhi is a small chain of moderately priced, small and friendly hotels. The staff worked very hard to please. The hotel was clean and comfortable, certainly a 3+ star."
775,Hotel Florence is truly a nice hotel to be in especially when you want a reasonable or mid range hotel. Room services were also round the clock and I felt that all the staff members have very jolly and friendly nature.
776,"The breakfast on the first day of our stay consisted of scrambled eggs and toasts with jam though we expected buffet. We were told that only 4 rooms are occupied, so there is no reason to cook for a buffet. And there was no hot water when we arrived at 11 o'clock at night."
777,Hotel Florence is located close to Delhi's most famous shopping hub called Karol bagh. The hotel facilities and rooms are of excellent quality. Staff are extremely friendly and cooperative.
778,"Florence is situated in the busy areas of Karol Bagh. Florence wins hands down in value for money. Only Drawback : Repetitive Breakfast , the same everyday."
779,"We stayed at Hotel Florence just the final night before flying back home after 2 weeks of travelling around Rajasthan. The hotel was clean and the staff very friendly, but the whole décor was rather old and stuffy."
780,"The rooms are small, but well appointed and well maintained, with Mini Bars and excellent restaurant on the top floor. In a city where quality and price do not always carry the relationship that one would anticipate, Hotel Florence is a very safe choice."
781,"Staying in this hotel was a big mistake. Next time, I will do my research on tripadvisor and stay somewhere much nicer. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone."
782,"This place is okay, it is clean and the staff tries to be helpful. We were still quite disappointed, because the place is anything but cheap for Indian standards. The location, Karol Bagh, is inconveniently located and an unattractive neighbourhood."
783,"The deluxe room, where I stayed for two nights, was a bit small but not cramped. The smell of moth balls that were placed in different parts of the room was an assault to the senses. As a solo traveler, I felt safe here."
784,"This hotel is ok, not great, but something decent for those on budget. Location is in the shopping areas, althought most of Delhi is like a shopping area."
785,A nice hotel with new features and friendly staff. Manager/Owner Daljeet Singh was very helpful in assiting me from the ever changing enquiry for my group. Staff were great and will stay again next time we go.
786,"Stayed for 2 nights on way to Mussoorie ans again a night on way back. Room was clean, spacious and with all basic amenities. Location is ideally suited for shopping but rather conjested and noisy."
787,This is my 8th year at this hotel now upgraded to a good quality. The owerners were very pleasant helpful and treated us like family. The food was excellant brilliantly cooked the bosses eat there.
788,"Was pleasantly suprised, I stayed in the Good Palace for 1 night before my tour and 2 nights after my tour. They have helpful staff who at first may seem a bit standoffish but will do anything for you if needed. Also have great room service (some of the best food I tasted in India), and their rooms are neat and nice."
789,"Hotel Good Palace is in the middle of one of the busiest parts of Delhi. It's a budget hotel for travellers looking for a decent place to stay. You won't pay premium rates to stay here, so don't expect a premium hotel."
790,The hotel is located in a noisy part of the city. The rooms were small and poorly insulated. The staff tried to be helpful. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless they like noisy places!
791,"A little dirty, languid staff, few amenities--our air conditioner was ot connected, unsure whether it would work if needed. However, it was quiet and had the basics necessary for a stay."
792,"Really nice place - close to the metro station, helpful staff, clean and tasteful rooms. We felt really lucky to have found this place."
793,"For the price, you will not find a cleaner or larger hotel room. Owner Mr.Madan is a wealth of info, and will book tours and help you book train and flights."
794,We stayed a night and wanted to extend for 2 more nights but the hotel staff was very greedy and the rooms are old. We moved to other hotel.
795,"All the staff were very friendly and accommodating. We were given a bottle of water per day, per person. The food was fairly inexpensive (for a hotel) and tasty."
796,Very isolated - long walk to train station. Taxi/rickshaws tell youthey know where it is but don't. filthy street even by Delhi's standards. Grim breakfast. Redeeming feature - flashy showers - ifthey worked properly!
797,"India and the streets of Delhi are a long way from what we are used to in the Netherlands, the subway at rush hour? ehm ..an experience. The rooms are pretty big and clean and better then a lot of hotels we've been to in European countries."
798,They like only white europeans and can discriminate you beouse of your low potential to pay for tours. They can trouble you be being bad to you and will give you a very bad room like dungeon.
799,"Staff are always polite and quick to respond to all your needs. After check out care was fantastic, they really went the extra mile. The rooms were very clean and tidy, basic but comfortable."
800,"The rooms are simple but large and clean. The room service and hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The area is centrally located, busy at daytime but very quite during the nights."
801,This is a very basic but very clean Hotel with some of the friendliest staff members I have ever met during my years of travels! They have a small room for breakfast and it turned out that the mornign get together there was quite entertaining as we met fellow travellers from all over the world.
802,"The location was initially daunting- but after afew days in India I realised this was the norm. The Karol Bagh area is actually quite good, not touristy so you don't get too much bother. The service while not warm is very efficient and trust worthy."
803,"This hotel is okay. The area is fine, not the best, but safe to walk around. Lots of markets and shops to go to. There is the most awesome resturant as you follow the hotels directions."
804,The hotel did not pick us up from the airport. The rooms were very basicand at cheaper price we stayed in better rooms in Karol Bagh. Not a good choice.
805,"Staff were extremely helpful and looked out for us as we were unprepared for the craziness of the city of Delhi. The rooms were spotless, the beds were very comfortable and we had no complaints whatsoever. I would highly recommend it."
806,"Hotel had free bottled water, clean sheets, towels and bathroom. Staff were very friendly and helpful even when we had to wake them up at 4.30am to check out."
807,"Air condition was not working, doors make sound while closing, salt stains in bathroom wall, life seems old too, and surrounding area is bad, economy hotel. Good for few hours stay at cheap price."
808,Hot water was not reliable but was there 70% of the time. Air conditioning likewise! Staff could not be more helpful. Only improvement I'd suggest is a more western menu for room service.
809,"The hotel was very clean, hotel staff pleasant and helpfull and the travel desk within the hotel is great! Location is OK, although not many rickshaw drivers knew it, fortunately the business card of the hotel had a route description."
810,"Hotel Grand Park Inn is located in the heart of Delhi, India. The hotel's owner, Mr. Madan Pai, arranged for a driver to take his guests to interesting sites around the city."
811,The Grand Park Inn is located in the centre of Delhi. It is a short trip by autorickshaw or taxi from the airport. The rooms are more than adequate.
812,The hotel is surrounded by auto shops primarily for motorcyles. Day and night there are men everywhere however I was never harassed or felt unsafe. The metro is not that far away however getting across the busy road to access it is a real adrenaline rush... not for the faint hearted!
813,"Rooms are very clean, comfortable and with reazonable size. Manager makes everything possible to satisfy his guests. Pick up &amp; drop off service from/to the airport is also reliable."
814,The rooms were very comfortable clean spacious and well appointed. The location was perfect with easy access to markets bazaars and sightseeing areas.Transport was pre-arranged with the hotel.
815,The facilities are great as it is very near to Karol Bagh market and an auto rickshaw ride away from Connought place. The staff are great and very efficient both in the hotel and restaurant.
816,"The Grand Park Inn is located in the heart of Delhi. It is close to the metro station, auto rickshaws and buses to travle round Delhi."
817,"I have stayed at the Grand Park Inn for the past 5 years and have been impressed by the clean and neat and comfortable rooms. The efficient staff and the GM , Mr Madan Pai who has his finger on the pulse.I can recommend this Hotel to international tourists without hesitation."
818,Neat and Clean hotel. Worth for the price. The lunch and the complementary break fast were very tasty. It had most of the things that you look in a hotel.
819,"i had stayed in many hotels in delhi, but grand park, is extremely nice and comfortable hotel, staff is great very freindly abd specially owners are there themselves to check all our requirements, very clean place to live in ....harry"
820,"The owner/manager helped us with everything, from arranging a low-priced visit to Agra, food purchases, and restaurant recommendations. The location was great to reach some of the best parts of Delhi and New Delhi."
821,"We stayed at the Grand Park Inn for the first time last year and we could not fault it. The servis and clenliness is second to none, and the organisation was excelent. We intend going to Delhi again next year, and because of the way we are treated by everyone concerned, we will be staying there yet again."
822,It was average hotel but I am still satisfied with my stay. The only thing I did not like much was its location which is a very busy and congested lane.
823,Hotel organised a taxi for us for the day (recommended) However we got annoyed when he kept bringing us to places (shops) where he'd get commission if we bought something.
824,Very clean and centrally located. Complimentary HOT breakfast with choice of continental or Indian menu. Provision for left baggage for returning guests away on short excursions.
825,Location is not so good and price is too much. Unnecessary huge rooms but not at all professional behaviour. Staff are terriblly poor knowledged.
826,The room i stayed was clean. The room service was good. The food served was tasting OK. All-in-All value for money.
827,"Decent Hotel, good for an overnight stay. One could be put off by the location. The complimentary breakfast is a simple parantha type of thing, but tasty nevertheless."
828,"1) Excellent clean rooms2) Good Food3) Value for moneyDownside1) No internet. If you want a decent room to crash out in the night, go for it."
829,"Grand Park Inn in Delhi, India is one of the best hotels in the city. Mr Madan Pai is the owner of the hotel. He arranged for my parents to stay at the hotel when my mother fell critically ill. Mr Pai personally contacted my husband and informed him of the situation. He provided my parents with a car and driver for 8 days. He topped up my mobile's airtime to the tune of Rs400."
830,Mr. Madan Pai and his staff were the ultimate in pleasant but serious service and hospitality. The neighborhood is colorful but the Inn is clean which was what we were looking for.
831,Located in Karol Bagh this hotel is not included in the regular guide books. Don't be put off by the location surrounded by motor parts shops as the hotel is well situated for the metro.
832,"Location is not ideal for lone female travellers - the area is made up of car repair companies - therefore, there are very few females to be seen within the area. Hotel manager was grumpy the first few days but cheered up on the third day."
833,The hotel was on a small busy Delhi street; a cow was parked nearby one of the days we were there. Breakfast was served in a conference room where we met fellow travelers. We were able to explore all over Delhi from our base in Karol Bagh.
834,hotel grand park inn Delhi india. We had booked this hotel initialy to start our tour in india but it happened so that arrangement was cancelled. When contacted the management they were so considerate and without any fuss it was dealth with sympathy and we eventualy stayed their.
835,The Grand Park Inn is located in a non-tourist market area of Rajasthan. The hotel is quiet and has a quaint charm. The staff are unfailingly polite and helpful.
836,"The hotel was spotless and the room very pretty luxurious for Delhi standards, specially for this price range! The location was pretty good, close to &quot;city centre&quot;"" - Connaught Place, although you will need to cross some dangerous roads to get to the metro. The manager was extremely helpfiul and I recommend to use him to get a travel package set-up to see the golden triangle."
837,"I spent three weeks in the Grand Park Inn because I was in Delhi for business and had made some bad experiences in other places. The room was very big, the TV worked well, the fridge even had a generator (which continued working during elecricity blackouts) The hotel staff was friendly (all young males), but sometimes struggled with their English."
838,"Hotel was our first hotel in Delhi, and we found everything apart from the breakfast and location to be very good. The rooms were very spacious, we only had a standard and felt it was far more than most hotels gave us. The staff were very friendly and helpful, we got a car organised free to take us from the airport on arrival and to the station on departing free of charge. So all in all a good stay Between a 3 and a 4 definetely."
839,Stayed at the Hotel Grand Park Inn in January this year. Staff and the owner/manager were lovely - especially the manager who allowed us to use his computer for free to do an on-line check in at the airport.
840,"Felt homely, calm and safe. Room interiors were above average. Management need to train the staff on communication skills. Food was good."
841,The Grand Park Inn is a good clean hotel with great staff. The hotel is quite near the centre of Delhi in a safe area. You can ask the hotel to arrange a pick up and drop off for you at the airport.
842,"Newly renovated and literally spotless - highest mark for cleanliness. Breakfast area is too small, people have to wait. Room service is quite good ( if you close your eyes on a bit of cheating)"
843,"we stayed 3 nights, but our experience was terrible. A lot of noise and the staff sometimes was insistent the sheets weren't clean."
844,The Grand Park Inn is a very reasonably priced hotel in Delhi. But its location - Karol Bagh - is a less-than-nice location. And the management is awful.
845,"The room rate is cheap by Delhi standards, and the hotel is clean. On our first night, we were shifted to a nearby hotel because the Grand Park Inn was full. The elevator at the Blue Bell got stuck between two floors after a power outage."
846,We were very impressed with our room at Hotel Grand Park Inn. The bathroom had a bath! There wasn't much hot water and you had to call the reception to turn the hot water on.
847,"The Grand Park Inn was our in our first destination New Delhi and also our fourth stop, en route to Kolkata. It was a very pleasant and reliable experience. The rooms were sparkling clean and service is immaculate, including some personal tourplanning."
848,"For 25USD a night, we had a suite with 3 beds, I guess is designed for a family? Room is large &amp; clean, and the bathroom is clean and with good hot water supply. Sounds insulations can improve a bit as we can hear dogs barking throughout the night."
849,Hotel Ananda is located in the Karol Bagh area of New Delhi. The location is good for browsing the markets and is close to the Metro. The rooms are decent - ok size and generally clean.
850,We were originally booked to stay in the Ananda Hotel and were then moved to this more expensive hotel. The lobby of the Grand Peepal is a bit drab and depressing. The rooftop restaurant didn't really appear to be a going concern whilst we were staying there.
851,I wouldn't stay here again. They refused to give us a receipt as proof of payment unless we paid them an extra 1000 rupees. The man and woman at the desk started got into a fierce argument about something and didnt care that there were guests in their presence. The food I ordered was really good too.
852,My stay in this hotel is not good because Hotel is not clean and bad service . Very dirty smell in the hotel because outside of the hotel is a big dustbin where all the hotel waste integrated but no manage it. Rates of the Hotel is very high compare to quality and service.
853,"This was second stay at Grand Peepal. I visited Delhi in May also and the service was excellent then too. Front desk staff was very attentive to my needs and safety, especially as a single woman traveling alone."
854,I booked this Hotel Through a Travel Agent (Incredible Heritage Tours) my stay here was for great. the staff was helpfull and the reception always warm welcoming!!!I was here on bussiness but also Travelled abit.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ALL TRAVELLER AND ALSO THE BUSSINESS PEOPLE.
855,I stayed at this hotel for 32 days and I couldn't stop myself for not posting any review about it. I'm pretty sure that most of India tourists search Internet to find a proper hotel before traveling just like me. I hope this info help them. First of all notice that here is not a luxury hotel and those tourists who look for economy hotels may choose this one.
856,"The rooms were excellent, large, clean and well equipped. Restaurant food was fairly good but a fairly limited choice. Bar area was okay but dirty from dust from construction work."
857,The only thing good about this hotel is location. It located in Connaught place which is the heart of Delhi. The rooms are very big &amp; spacious but not well maintained.
858,Not worth the rent charged; food not very good; rooms look old with stained walls; albeit large; should be maintained properly; may not stay their the next time.
859,Hotel Janpath location is good and close to connaught Place. Front desk response is average and service is slow. Hotel Janpath is located in the heart of the city.
860,"Paid 160 USD for one night at what was supposed to be a 4 star hotel. Slept with a chair jammed against the door. Lifts, corridors and path to room was filthy and badly lit."
861,The hotel is okay but we liked the restaurant more because of its good food and live ghajals program. its good to be there with family and friends and enjoy the party.
862,"We stayed at Janpath to get our infant son out of the Diwali noise and air pollution. The beds were too narrow and uncomfortable, the wooden tiles on the floor were creaky, the AC was turned on full blast turning the room into an ice chest. The food was too full of chillies and not really good anyway."
863,I was sponsored by CNN-IBN a trip to Delhi to watch the 1st ODI between India-England in March 2006. Upon reaching Delhi I was transferred to Hotel Janpath for my stay. The hotel was awesome and I have never experienced such incredible service before.
864,i loved the way of their welcome to the guest......the facilities were good.........there is slight problem of room adjustment but it can't be mind.......overall its a good experience.
865,"The hotel is located off of Janpath in a dilapidated looking side alley. The rooms I was shown had NO windows and while it seemed like it might be clean, my 200Rs budget hotel at Cozy Hotel was looking a lot more chic, clean and safe by the minute."
866,Food is very overpriced at a cup of coffee costs more than Rs.80. The rooms are quite spacious but have minimal facilities. Do not expect fast billing before 12 noon and give notice atleast 1 1/2 hours before. Hotel staff are not very friendly and seem quite cold.
867,"Staff were unhelpful, the food below average and the rooms ill equipped. Many rooms appear to be derelict and abandoned. We both agreed we had stayed in far better hotels in major European capitals for less than a quarter the price we paid here."
868,"I did not stay at this hotel but I did visit prior to ouractual stay there. The location of the hotel is greatand by the appearance driving up it looked veryfavorable considering the price. The lobby was small, not grand at all but clean and presentable. The room doors were old, didn't see safe and I couldn't believe what I was seeing."
869,HI This is Alam. Me and my Friend stayed in this hotel in the month of October and we found hotel is good 4 star. You will find all the basic aminities that 4 star hotel should have. overall its good 4star . next time we will stay in this Hotel.
870,The Janpath is a 4* hotel in the heart of Delhi. It has the world's loudest air conditioning. It also has faulty electrics that constantly throw out sparks.
871,"Great location just off the circle, but upon check in I was thoroughly disgusted. I was given the filthiest hotel room I have ever seen. Don't be tempted to stay - even for a minute."
872,"The Janpath would be lucky to receive two stars in any other country. The location is good, but the prices are ridiculous and the rooms are very basic. Three nights cost me nearly six hundred Australian dollars."
873,The Janpath is a run down hotel which should never be classed as 4 star. The rooms we were given were very basic and from the looks of the doors it looked like the rooms had been broken into.
874,"Janpath is a government run hotel, part of the ashok group. The rooms were surprisingly clean (including the sheets) The price was about $150 with taxes which seems to be about average for this class of hotel."
875,When we made reservations we were told this hotel was a 4 star. The rooms were dirty. no hot water at anytime. Bathroom had mold everywhere. Staff was rude.
876,"Janpath was recommended to us by cousins who also had children visiting India for the first time, and they said they had a good experience. We paid way too much for the stay we got - 4700rs/night. The room, though large, was very worn, the bed was inadequate sized."
877,I stayed in this hotel with family for one night. The rooms were very dirty with torn carpet. It was much worse than some hostels where I have stayed. The staff was rude.
878,"The hotel was an absolute disgrace, there was no cleansiness we stayed 1 night and we did not even unpack our suitcases slept in our clothes. They insist on payment upfront which should of got the alarm bells ringing. DO NOT STAY HERE"
879,"We prebooked the hotel online with Asia.com. When we arrived at the receptionist, it didn't too bad. Once we got to the third floor where our room was, the ambience resemble that of the under funded 1950s Lunatic Asylum. No hot water at all despite the fact that the staff came up twice to fix it."
880,"Terrible, horrible, pathetic, despicable, bad can't find enough negative adjectives for this hotel. Rooms are like they have never been cleaned, bathrooms are like everyone in the hotel uses one single bathroom. Can't imagine this hotel is still functioning."
881,"My experience was terrible. When we got to Janpath from Jaipur, we were rudely told that there was no reservation. The room was not comfortable and for the first time we both decided to forgoe on the bath/shower as it was stained. It was also dark and noisey."
882,The hotel wanted payment the same day we checked in. They then insisted we pool our money for all the rooms and pay at one time since they had no change to give us. The worst part was their so called security guard.
883,"Cigarette butts were all over the floor, and the bed sheets were stained... and the bathroom!?? OMG, I don't even want to talk about it. Do not stay at this hotel. You don't want to waste ~$70/night for this crap."
884,"This is NOT 'Jukaso Inn', it is 'Hotel Jukasi Inn' - these are 2 different hotels. The A/C was so-so as you couldn't choose a personal setting, it was basically a grill in the wall with cool air coming in. It had 1 computer for internet use and at 68Rs per hour wasn't very cheap."
885,"Room 303 is sometimes very loud as the Kitchen of the rooftop restaurant is right above it, otherwise the area was quiet during nighttime. We had problems to find the place as the location on google maps was wrong."
886,"I can't use my laptop here, no internet access , my client wanted to visit me but can't find this hotel, the telephone operator was bad and rude with him while helping him with the directions."
887,We chose this hotel for our over-night stay in Delhi. The place is good value for the money. It definitely needs a little polish here and there... but our bathroom was spotless!
888,"The hotel is down a bustlig side street. It is clean and the rooms are well apointed, nice double bed, TV and clean bathroom. AC and room fan available. Good selection of room service and upstairs restaurant."
889,"I stayed at Lals Haveli for one week in September 2009 at the end of a 15 month trip around the world. The room was not the biggest I had stayed in but was clean, nicely decorated, and had everything I was promised. The food was traditional Indian food, not westernised, but excelent quality."
890,"The rooftop restaurant provides great food at cheap prices. Don't be put off by the area , give this place a chance and I am sure you will find the same wonderful hospitality."
891,"Good location -right near pahar ganj, so very busy and dirty area. Fab sweet shop just outside. Place is very clean and safe but desperately needs a refurb."
892,"Rooms are much better than what the reception promise. Spacy and cozy, with clean bathrooms. As the area has many hotels, it will be difficult to find a better value."
893,Great hospitality with good priced rooms. Very simple design which is comfortable and spacious. Bathrooms are spacious and very clean. Staff are courteous and friendly and the food on the roof top terrace is amazing.
894,"I was given two rates for Deluxe &amp; Semi Deluxe rooms. When I asked what is the difference between them, the receptionist was very curt and said you can come and see the difference. They badly need to train their staff for a decent behavior."
895,amazing locationnice and clean new roomsvery good value for moneycourteous staff.would give it 5 outta 5 out of 5.
896,This hotel was much more than I expected for the price! I arranged a late night pickup and they were there and waiting. The staff was plentiful and courteous. The room was large and very clean.
897,"The hotel is located in the Paharganj area of New Delhi. The room was clean, but the sheets and pillow covers weren't quite washed, and frankly I killed 4 cockroaches while I was there. The bathroom itself was truly spotless, which was the biggest saving grace of this hotel. The internet cafe and nearby restaurant were the bomb."
898,"Le Roi Hotel is located in the crowded area but it very closed to the Metro station that can connected to Rajiv Chock. A lot of restaurant and money changer surrounding the hotel, but if you wanna eat in the restaurant of hotel...its also really delicious food."
899,"We visited hotel Le Roi with friends in november 2009, we felt very nice and comfortable, stuff were very kind and helpful, we enjoyed our staying very much. I can recommend this hotel to every one who stays in Delhi."
900,Le Roi is a new hotel in Paris. It is very clean and spacious. The room does have little greatness (the air con was very quiet) and all in all it is a very good apartment.
901,I was on a Business Trip earlier this month and got a chance to Stay in Hotel Le Roi.I was very glad with the level of service and Facillities this hotel provides.Besides A one Services this hostel is located in very comfortable location.
902,After exhausted day of touring colossal city of New Delhi was great experience to find retreat and refreshing in Le Roi Hotel. Atmosphere is so nice. Staff was very friendly and professional. Very clean hotel .I already recommended this place to my friends. Hope to be back next year..
903,"I was on my business trip to Mauritius and India[ New Delhi ] in November 1st week. It was very comport,very clean &amp; tidy, best room service with respect. My all travel arrangement done by Trip Advisor."
904,Hotel Rooms Speaks of Quality and Elegance. Le Roi provides the feel of a private Residence yet provides the service and Facillity of Modern Hospital.
905,"Le Roi is a brandnew hotel (sept 2009) in the middle of the crowded noisy touristic Paharganj area. It is quiet, modern, has the best soft beds we have had in India and a perfect warm shower. And it is not too expensive, good value for money!"
906,"Found Hotel Le Roi on TripAdvisor and am very thankful, so I shall share my thoughts and experience. Great price, great hotel &amp; exceptional service. Only problem I faced was a slight connection error from my room to the internet."
907,The location is very crowded. The roomservice is poor as they do not listen to us for older of food. It isaverage hotel. I came to this hotel on the recommendation of TRIPADVISER.
908,The Hotel &quot; le roi is a very good hotel in New Delhi. The prices are good and also it's located in a nice area. If you stop in Delhi i highly recomand you to go there.
909,"I had an excellent stay at hotel le roi, it was a clean and nice place, rooms were comfortables and the staff helpfull and nice. The hotel has a very central location. I really recommend this hotel for any stay, business or holidays."
910,Newly opened in central Pahar Ganj. Right by the central railway station (ask for the imperial cinema and you'll walk past Le Roi) The hotel itself stands out for the others in the area being larger although still relatively small(it would be classed boutique size in the UK)
911,"My spouse and I arrived at the Hotel Legend around 9pm after a long flight. Our bags had not arrived, so we were tired and all we could thing of was a hot shower and food. Upon arrival at the hotel we received a very cold welcome at the reception. We were told if we want food to call the kitchen, however upon calling to place an order we were told they didnt have any food. The staff ordered food for us from outside and charged us 3 times the price. When it came time for a shower, one EACH night we had to request the staff to turn on the hot water. Our bed sheets had to be changed twice because they were blood stained and it seemed like the sheets were never changed from the previous occupants."
912,"Hotel Legend is a budget property in the heart of backpacker district. The only sheet on the bed was quite stained and I had to ask for a top sheet to use with the questionably clean blanket. We did have hot water, but the toilet didn't flush, which wasn't a huge surprise."
913,"Hotel Legend International looked impressive on their website but was a fairly average hotel. The location was fine - walking distance to restaurants but a lengthy rickshaw ride to Chandi Chowk, fort etc. Lots of staff at the hotel that seemed to just sit around and argue but not do a whole lot of work."
914,It's in a great central location right next to New Delhi train station which is helpful for internal travel. The Metro also stops here so it's good for getting around the city. The only real negative aspect of our stay was the behaviour of the Travel Agent in the lobby.
915,"Friendly staff, very pleasant rooms and great location and value. Some of our group found the area a bit intimidating. It is a vibrant hectic place with a tourist road right amoungst the locals."
916,"If you are willing to be a taxi-ride away from the action, this hotel was really quite good! They had a large service staff who were welcoming and smiling at every opportunity. The food was wonderful for any meal of the day, and none of the 18 of us got sick!"
917,Stayed there for two nights Aug.2009. Excellent location--close to New Delhi Train Station and Connaught Place. Breakfast is included but is NOT buffet style. Tipping is appreciated--and can go a long way to better service.
918,"I booked the hotel from england, before travelling to delhi, as all previous reviews had been pretty positive. There were 9 of us in total (3 families including kids) We were picked up from the airport (taxi driver waited even though we were about 2 hours late), taken to the hotel,check in was quick, and I was really impressed with the rooms. The whole stay cost me around £100, that includes airport pickup, and drop off at the railway station."
919,"Although the rooms were quite small, they are no smaller than those in hotels in other cities elsewherein the world. The rooms were very clean. The staff were very helpful."
920,"For what we paid, it really wasn't value for money. 'Very hard sale' by the in-hous travel agent was annoying and worth avoiding at all costs."
921,This hotel was comfortable and very easy on my budget. It is located a short walk from the New Delhi train station and Metro stop. The online booking process was easy and accurate.
922,"There's nothing really wrong with this place - the staff are ok, the room was acceptable and the bathroom is fine. It's a great location for a number of things - New Delhi train station is 5 mins walk away, and they have an excellent facility for travellers to book train tickets. You're also 3mins by rickshaw from Connaught Place and not much further from chaotic Old Delhi."
923,We booked here after reviews on this site seemed good but only stayed here for a quick nap as we arrived 11 hours late at 10am the next morning. The room was clean enough but there was no hot water and the toilet didn't flush - it just sprayed water from it's pipework across the bathroom floor. The good thing about the hotel is it is only a 5 minute walk to New Delhi train station - can't think of much else though!
924,"We enjoyed a 5 day stay at this hotel. Staff were ok, not overly friendly but not rude. Room itself was very comfortable and spacious. Free internet in the lobby."
925,"The rooms were pretty much as expected although ours had no windows, and service was acceptable. We had some items stolen from our luggage there, which included a small amount of cash, I miss the money clip more than the dollars. Part of the problem is that everyone in the lobby knows your plans."
926,"This was my first experience of a hotel in India, the first stop in a three week trip. Of the horror stories I had read about hotels I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. The staff were friendly, we were able to use the Internet in the lobby whenever we wanted."
927,The hotel could be freshened up a bit as the pictures look much nicer than what you actually get. It is really noisy (both the city and the staff are extremely noisy) and it feels a bit overpriced.
928,"The rooms are pretty basic and the towels could definitely stand to be replaced, but the bed was comfortable and it was nice to have TV in the room. Breakfast is okay, but dinner is fantastic. The travel guy in the lobby is definitely shady and will change his quoted price every time you talk with him."
929,"The Paharganj market district is one of Indias must see attractions. The Hotel is satisfactory in every way, clean rooms and good service. A good budget hotel."
930,"We always make it a point to head straight for this hotel whenever we are in New Delhi. All the services are nearby, the rail station is so close and Connaught Place is just a short rickshaw ride away. It can be a bit noisy with all the room service buzzers going off but it's clean, inexpensive, and the service is great. We'd recommend this hotel to anyone!"
931,"The hotel is located in one of the worse locations in New Delhi. There was no hot water, limited amounts of toilet paper, the TV channels kept going and the noise from outside was so bad that even ear plugs could not block it out. I would not recommend the breakfast, also the guy who sells the tours was very shady, kept changing prices????"
932,"The rooms are quite smallish, but comfortable enough. Walls are extremly thin, and you can hear every word being said in the hall. We even had a bellboy stationed outside our room, and even thought he didn't understand a word of danish, privacy was limited."
933,"Stayed at the hotel in the first week of March with my wife and 3 yr old daughter. Good clean rooms, with decent food, average hospitality. Happy with their luggage storage facility."
934,We booked to stay at the hotel legend for 3 nights in february. We informed the hotel via email that we would be arriving late at night and they agreed to meet us at the airport. When we arrived at 2am there was a group of men sitting in reception. We were told that the hotel was full and to come back tomorrow.
935,A good clean and safe hotel in a fantastic part of Delhi. Very close to the railway station and only a 5 minute auto ride from Connaught Place. Although there is no restaurant as such the food is very good.
936,As other reviewers I liked Legend and stayed a total of 8 nights. Compared to others in this price range (1200-1500 Rs) the rooms are well furnished. Staff are friendly and the food is good and tasty (rooftop seating available)
937,"The Legend Hotel is located in the heart of the capital, New Delhi. It's a little higher than our usual budget, but having a comfortable place to get over jet lag was worth it. Everything is very new."
938,The international legend is a good choice because:1. The cleaning is very good. After cleaning the room smells good. I liked the doors. Do not buy tours from travel agency in the hotel.
939,Booked the hotel through email. rate of 2250rs incl tax and breakfast for a super deluxe. the room itself dont quite feel like super del Deluxe. the window was tiny and gave no view at all.
940,"The hotel is in a good location and the staff were very helpful. We had to ask for the air con and the hot water to be switched on. On the whole though, a pretty good place for the price."
941,"The hotel is very clean, the staff are very polite and nothing is too much trouble. The bedsheets were a little worn but this was not really a major problem. If you are looking for a reasonably priced, clean hotel for a few nights in Delhi then this is the perfect place."
942,"I and my wife stayed at Hotel Legend, New Delhi for 3 nights in September. The Interiors of the hotel is real good(specially their 1st floor lobby) and service is also good. Only 1 problem they have internet in the lobby, no Wifi net."
943,"I've been to Delhi many times for bussiness. The hotel price in Delhi is very expensive according to their level. I found this hotel by tripadvisor and tried, it's a surprise to have such a good hotel at this price."
944,"i'd tried to book hotel ajanta close to hotel legend, but it was booked up so i was placed in hotel legend instead. had a room on the top floor and it was a pleasant surprise, clean, spacious and quiet."
945,The hotel is not very clean. Staff is ok. Near airport. Dining room ok. But I would suggest finding a 3 star hotel.
946,This hotel is very practically situated near the airports. The rooms are quite spacious and fairly well equipped. One negative point is that it can be quite noisy at night due to the traffic on the highway just outside the hotel.
947,"I booked this hotel through Makemytrip. It was a nice hotel, and specially recommended for people who are travelling through airlines, because it is close to both airports. Condition of room was excellent(neat, clean &amp; tidy)."
948,The bed sheets were in fact filthy and disgusting. The amount of disgusting stains on the matress and bed padding was simply disgusting. I do not recommend you stay here if you want a clean place. You are better off in any other hotel.
949,"There were blood and other unknown stains on the sheets, bugs on the floor, and neither the hot water nor the heater worked. The hot water in the bathroom sink began to work, but not in the shower so we had to use the dipping bucked to transfer water to the shower."
950,"The rooms are well-sized, the beds ok, but staying their in the winter is extremely cold and draughty (no heater) The hotel is simply not well-managed!"
951,"Lohias is on a highway that runs along the airport, but is about an 8-minute ride from/to the terminal. Adequate air conditioning, clean, hot water shower, accommodating and pleasant staff that went out of its way to help."
952,"The Lohias is a good choice for an overnight if you are arriving or departing from the airport at an inconvenient hour. The room was quite big, clean by Indian standards, and there was hot water in the shower."
953,"Some pros and some cons. No hot water. Beds and room okay, but bathroom not so clean. Three agressive bell boys insisted on helping with our two bags upon jet-lagged arrival."
954,"The hotel is situated on a good location, not far from anything if you have a driver (we had one through the hotel) or if you use the three wheelers. The staff were very helpful and friendly! We also got to know the hotel owner; mr. Naresh (Pintoo) when we wanted to book train tickets for Agra."
955,The hotel is clean the staff is somewhat efficiant and they all want to make your stay as happy as possible. It is highly recommended for a comfortable and easy stay in New Dehli!
956,Hotel was picked up from the airport by an excellent driver directly to the hotel. Direct communication with the owner wich can tell you a lot about india. If wanted he can arrange for fixed prices day trips and you'll be treated like his guest all the way.
957,"My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Madonna on three separate occasions. We really liked the night manager, Tripathi and our taxi driver, Kashmira. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff could not be nicer."
958,"Found staff and owner, Mr Naresh, to be very helpful and really enjoyed the tour organised by the hotel to Agra and Jaipur. Will definitely recommend."
959,stayed for 2 nights whilst we did the taj and delhi sightseeing. Not many places to eat around the hotel but we found a little veg restaurant up the road. Had a superb thali for £1 hotel restaurant... well its not arestaurant really.
960,We had a wonderful time here thanks to Mr. Naresh who provided us excellent services. He was very professional and a nice human being making us feel like at home.
961,Hotel was a good clean hotel right in good location to the main attractions of Dehli. The staff were brilliant and very helpful and polite. The price was very reasonable.
962,"The hotel car and driver (complimentary) was waiting for us at the airport complete with sign. Puri, the driver, is probably the best driver in all of India, plus he also was very knowlegeable, and professional."
963,"The room was so-so, with a refrigerator, hot showers. They did have wi-fi (not in room), cable tv, and by the way the restraunt sucks. Overall you can find a better place, us this as a last resort."
964,"Had a brilliant stay the hotel was comfortable and clean and provided everything we needed including a brilliant sightseeing tour of Dehli. The staff were the best and had a warm personnality. The location is spot on in the right part of town close to the sights and the conveinence of the ATM's, Banks, Shops ... thoroughly recommend this hotel when staying in Delhi."
965,The hotel is rmarkable in its hospitality and caring attitude of all staff and management. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. Being fussy about ablution facilities we felt very at home in the neat and superb facilties.
966,Hotel Madonna in Pushkar is a real gem. Owner Naresh Bhattia set us up with a superb and resourceful driver who also turned out to be a great traveling companion.
967,The only thing need to be upgraded is the shower. The train is nearby the hotel and very nice to ride in. The Hotel had tour trip if you want to see other part of New Delhi.
968,This is the second time I have stayed at the Hotel Madonna in Delhi. I was again picked up from the airport free of charge at 03:00 in the morning. The manager even has a spare GSM card for emergency guest use.
969,Hotel Madonna is overpriced and not in a desirable location. Staff couldn't get their computer running Windows 95 to work. There are much better places to stay in Delhi.
970,"I am a customer since last three years for the hotel madonna, the first time I visted india I was not familiar with india. The hotel owner Mr. Narish was a very open mind and nice person. Apart from the hotel was clean and all the people were working were so polite."
971,"We stayed in Hotel Madonna for the major part of our stay in India. In between, we made a trip to Jaipur and Agra organised by the hotel."
972,"We were warmly greeted at the airport,by hotel driver no charge.,Taken directly to hotel. Greeted by Mr.Singht at the hotel manager, asked if I wanted dinner. After dinner was escorted by the bellman [Sanjay] to my room which was immaculate and very clean with all western amenities."
973,"We were told to get any taxi and they would cover the cost. When we finally arrived at the hotel, the manager who was very rude proceeded to argue with the taxi driver and try to get us to pay. He tried to do the same the following morning when wanting to check out."
974,Hotel Madonna was recommended by a colleague on a business trip to India. The accommodation was of good European 3-4 star standard. The hotel also arranged my tour programme with the personal driver.
975,"Rooms were dirty, staff was unfriendly. I know I shouldn't expect much but it didn't fulfill the lowest standards."
976,The hotel is located on a busy street in the heart of Delhi. The rooms have carpet which is filthy and quite frankly carpet anywhere in India is a bad idea. The breakfast staff had very limited english and the breakfast was very average.
977,was picked up at the airport and taken to the hotel...delightful!!Check-in was quick and easy. Enjoyed the complimentary cookies every evening! Would certainly visit again.
978,"Hotel Madonna in Delhi was very convenient to all Delhi landmarks. Staff were great, literally waited on us hand and foot and arranged all our trips, which included Agra and Delhi sights."
979,"Arrived in middle of night by taxi, very expensive rider, operator did not have reservation, put us up in room, dirtY, smelly, slept on top of bed as someone had already slept on sheets. Had help with luggage, but would not leave until tipped and tipped well!Bathroom was very small, you could, sh_t, shave, shower all in one position as you could not do anything else! Supplies were limited to a little toilet paper, no soap, one wet towel.Checked out early, they do not take credit cards...what we were told, only cash."
980,"The staying was nice; it was a clean place. But especially, Naresh, the owner, is a greatly wonderfull friend that made our days in Delhi a safe, really nice trip."
981,"The Madonna hotel was reserved for us by a travel agent, reputedly a 3* hotel. The rooms were a bit grungy, the bathroom definitely a mess, although the shower was allright (warm water wise) The beds very very hard, and the rooms incredibly noisy."
982,"You can get a decent room, with some work for 30$ a night in Paharganj, which is more central than the madonna. The madonna staff wasn't particularly friendly -- and when they gave travel advice, you couldn't help feeling like they were scamming you."
983,"Stayed at the Hotel Madonna, ideal location to see the real Delhi. It is a clean and safe hotel by Delhi standards and the food was acceptable. Try the marsala omelette which is very tasty."
984,A decent Delhi hotel at a reasonable price. Near the Metro (5-10 minute walk) so accessible to much of Delhi. In a lively neighborhood with shopping opportunities all around.
985,Found this hotel through contact at Delhi airport and what a wonderful experience it turned out to be. Rooms were very comfortable and service excellent. We were also able to avail ourselves of the excellent service of Naresh Bhatia in organising a driver toshow us the sights of Delhi and a tour of Agra and Rajasthan.
986,"Hotel Madonna was a good size, bright, and most importantly clean. We also had airconditning, fridge and International TV channels. Staff were always friendly and nothing was ever too much trouble."
987,"The hotel room itself seemed clean and bug free, although the sheets were very stained. The bathroom smelt rather musty, although again itdid look quite clean. Both toilet paper and towels were both in shortsupply, with just one handtowel supplied (on one occassion this clearly hadn't been changed as it was dirty and wet!),"
988,"The hotel in general is clean, the restaurant underground does have an odor. The location is not too bad, 4 blocks away from subway/metro station. Keep in mind that the metro/subway itself doesn't cover much of Delhi."
989,"A very good hotel in Delhi, with clean rooms,excellent service, friendly and helpful staff. The hotel manager, Mr. Bathia was so friendly top arrange for usn a wo9nderful trip to Agra Pushkar and Jaipur."
990,"The bed was uncomfortable, the bathroom was fairly grungy. They do have an internet connection, but speeds are at 1992 levels. They threw in free breakfast (mediocre) and set up a driver for the day."
991,"I was in Delhi last year, my first time in India. I was a little bit afraid going alone but when I arrived at the aerport a guy from the hotel was waiting for me. The hotel is located near the metro, so very usefull to see the city. I'm going back in a few months, can't wait!"
992,"One year ago I was taled about the hotel, last year I came to Delhi and stayed in this hotle. The hotel hostility was really wonderful and I decided to come back with my wife. India will be our second home after Ethiopia."
993,"Delhi is a hard place to get accomodations under $100 that are reasonable. Hotel Madonna is not so bad, at $81 including taxes and breakfast. Not the cleanest hotel we ever stayed in."
994,"The room was clean, but very basic, and my bathroom had a direct opening to the outside. During the night when I got up to use the bathroom, there was a *bird* inside my bathroom - nearly scared the life out of me!"
995,Hotel is an autorickshaw ride away from the centre (3-4km) and with no real restaurant alternative in the imediate vicinity. The rooms were clean and well equiped with modern matching furniture. The food is okay and reasonably priced.
996,The hotel was good but the restaurant was of poor standard every time you entered it smelt really bad. If you do visit delhi be aware of profit making scandles your guide and taxi driver are usually in to make some money.
997,"Service was excellent and the owner, Naresh, was very helpful. Location is by Karol Bagh station, which is convenient to get to various places. Room was very clean, but if you can you should try and get a room in the back."
998,"There is a lack of mid-range hotels in India. The Madonna is a fair attempt at a mid range option. Pleasant enough rooms, free (but slooow) Internet, complementary breakfast and the possibility of walking to a metro station are positives."
999,Stayed here for a total of three nights and didn't really have much say on where I stayed as it was booked as part of a package. I couldn't agree more with the second to last reviewer especially with regard to the moth balls. The bathroom suite was black and the bath itself was peeling and a bit of a safety hazard.
1000,"JP Bed &amp; Breakfast Hotel in Karol Bagh is adjacent to the Mehar Castle. All new, with relatively generous, classy, ensuite rooms, tiled flooring and modern style furniture."
1001,"The hotel is in the main shopping area of Karol Bagh. It's not the safest area to start out in, but you can get good bargains, and it's close to the metro. They offer free internet but it's really slow."
1002,"Hotel provides good hospitality..we were provided with a family room which had two double beds..which was perfect for my wife and my two children. Good service,good food.."
1003,"Hotel is within about 5 minutes' walk to Karol Bagh metro station. Not spotlessly clean maybe, but quite decent. Hard mattresses, aircon working but wouldn't set to heating."
1004,"The staff is friendly, the rooms were clean and well decoated with a big L.C.D. Bathrooms were neat and hot water in the showers is available. The price they take is also not exorbitant."
1005,"The hotel provided a very uneven experience al round. The staff who actually did the work were lovely - but the management were dreadful. After a huge row they transferred us to a scruffier sister property, closer to the market."
1006,We were particularly happy with the convenient and central location Metro Heights had to offer us in delhi near the metro sation connecting to all parts of delhi. The staff was proffessional and friendly.
1007,We booked the hotel through the website which looked quite attractive and were promised a pickup from airport. Next morning we went to the restaurant serving breakfast somewhere down it was good set up and decent enough considering it was in the package as complimentary. Part of our stay was that the hotel was clean and safe for family.
1008,The Metro Heights is a basic hotel in the Karol Bagh area of Delhi. The staff were either indifferent to the needs and requests of their clients. The breakfast was a tired-looking buffet.
1009,Hotel Metro Heights was fine but not great value for money. Staff were largely unhelpful and the included breakfast left a lot to be desired. If you shop around I'm sure you could get a lot more for your money.
1010,"Most rooms are mere cupboards with a bed, with no windows. Staff-sideentrance is open at all times, so no security at all on all floors. Linen is dirty, the breakfastroom is disgusting as is the breakfast."
1011,The hotel rooms appear dark and uninviting. There are many hotels in Karol Bagh so just go to one of the others and check out the rooms.
1012,"We were disappointed in the take it or leave it attitude which is becoming more prevalent in New Delhi. We chose not to support this behavior by staying here again, and we moved next door to the Hotel Singh Sahib."
1013,"23 days in India at various hotels, but this was the worst. Staff are unfriendly, and un co-operative, especially towards females. Only stay here if you must or if it is part of you tour package."
1014,The ambience of a budget hotel but not a price to match. Staff delivered a service akin to that of Faulty Towers. Request for an extra bed in the room took a couple of hours.
1015,"Metro Heights is sort of best-you-can-get in the lower price range (up to $ 75) in Delhi. It is simple, has dark rooms (the one we had did not even have windows) and especially on the ground floor you hear a lot of noise from the reception."
1016,"Hotel Metro Heights, in Karolbagh, Delhi was our base in Delhi during our 3 week trip to India. The rooms are okay. The overall service is just poor and they have to be pushed real hard to get anything done. Warm water is not hot water, a concept that this hotel just did not understand."
1017,The hotel is decently priced and closer to the main shopping strip in Karol Bagh. Being a few blocks away ensures that the road noise is minimal. The service has been better than other hotels.
1018,"We chose this place to be near the train station as we flew in at midnight and needed to catch a 7am train. The room was small but he A/c worked and the twin beds were clean and not too hard. The shower was not totally clean, but for our 5 hours, it was fine."
1019,"Mohan International hotel is located in an alleyway in the centre of Delhi. The room was a good size, but even if the sheets and pillowcases had been cleaned, they certainly didn't look it. The area is very noisy at night, with staff shouting and music playing."
1020,We stayed at the Hotel Mohan International this month for one night. Although the room was very basic it was clean. I would recommend this hotel for travellers on a budget as it was cheap.
1021,"The hotel is very noisy, and the free &quot;breakfast was pretty disgusting. The guy who worked the front desk was horrendous. When I tried to book a taxi to the airport, he tried to charge me double what we paid on our way in."
1022,Stayed here for 3 days having booked on Expedia. It must have been decades since this hotel was last refurbished. Noiseof buzzers (for people calling from their room) and voices through thelate evening and early the next morning make it very difficult.
1023,Avoid this place - you may have seen in advertised on the STA website but I would guess that STA have not stayed here. It is a very basic hotel and the cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired. We paid 15 UK pounds per night as we wanted our first few nights accomodation sorted out before we arrived.
1024,"Rooms are reasonable, but the staff is horrible. Manager kept stalking me on the hotelroom phone about tours he wanted to sell. Staff didn't let me out of the hotel alone but were almost agressively pushy about arranging a city-tour."
1025,"What a scam. There are atleast 50 other similar hotels around this one and you don't need to book this online. If you are looking for this price range, simply get off the train at the main station, walk around."
1026,"Hotel Club is absolutely LYING about their location indicating that they are located at Connaught Place where several five star hotels are located. In fact, this place is located at the MAIN TRAIN STATION area which is a full 8 minutes by TAXI and quite a dangerous area even in the daytime. The price charged by Hotel Club (20 euros night) is OUTRAGEOUS for Delhi for a hotel of this type and shameful considering the condition."
1027,"We ebooked in advance and arranged a car to meet us at the airport, a very good tip as you WILL be ripped off by taxi drivers. Mohan is easy to find as it is directly behind the sheila cinema. Do not use the inhouse travel agent for taxi tours or car booking. We chose to use the ajanta hotels (200m away), even then we were advised to book from the company directly."
1028,"The room was horrible, the bathroom was filthy - i did not wash while i was there, we arrived to find cigarette butts in the toilet, sheets where dirty, We also saw several cockroaches (although this isnt exactlyt unusual in Delhi) The tipping point came when we could hear buzzing in the room which we though to be the electricity or fan, so after turning them on and off afew times we were stumped as to what it could be; went to go back to sleep picked up my pillow to reveal 2 huge cockroach underneath it."
1029,"Dirty bathroom, fan was so loud that we cant sleep, dirty bed-clothes. We paid for pick up from airport and driver didnt want to show us where the hotel is without a big tip."
1030,"Hotel Namaskar has just 2 pluses: first - its really cheap (480 rupees per room for four people) Second - has great location. Was really hot, fans were not enough, our room didnt have windows, bathrooms are owful."
1031,"The airport pickup worked perfectly for the price of quite expensive 700Rps. The rooms were budget, no hot water, accordingly not perfectly clean rooms. The biggest issue was the extremely loud A/C."
1032,"I stayed at the Hotel Namaskar when I first arrived in India on the 25th January. The staff were very friendly, the young Nepalese boys were great, and the other counter staff could not have been more helpful. The owner is a little intimidating, but once you get used to him he is actually quite nice."
1033,"Good location close to New Delhi train station, friendly staff, 1 hot shower available if you ask, very basic rooms, bit run down. Personally I would pay extra Rs150 for a room with private bathroom, hot showers, new, clean &amp; comfortable at Hotel Gush or Rak International."
1034,"I stayed at Hotel Namaskar after reading some reviews on a website that claimed it was a good deal and it was clean. Upon entry into the room, both of the sheets covering the mattress had blood stains on them. When I asked about a good restaurant in the area, I was told that they would get me the food and deliver it to my room. When they returned, they did not provide me with change or a receipt."
1035,"We booked the hotel for its price and reccomendation of guidebooks. The area of Paharganj is not the best in Delhi, so if you want anything remotely fancy don't stay here."
1036,"The hotel is located in the Paharganj, in an alley just off the main market street. It is walking distance to the metro (Rama Krishna Ashram Marg station), and one metro stop away from Connaught Place."
1037,This Hotel Namaskar is the first on top of the budget hotel list. The problem of accomodation being recommended by Lonely Planet is that the hotel will tend to be over booked or over popular.
1038,"Basic hotel in the Main Bazaar area. Rooms are cheap, relatively clean but very basic. Staff and especially the two brothers are extremely helpful."
1039,"I spent 3 nights in Namaskar hotel. The people of the hotel can take you from the airport, even during the night, for 400 rupies (8 euros) They can keep some of your luggage (even a computer) a few weeks until you come back. It is really near main bazar street."
1040,Location is midst of Karol bagh the populated area of Old Delhi. Room was very good though no balcony. Bathroom has new jacuuzi but it was not that effective and was malfunctioning.
1041,"i went to Delhi for a tour with my family consisting of 3 members. We had actually booked rooms in an other hotel but we reached late at nite coz of the big traffic block in delhi. The bed spread , linens etc were so untidy and had a foul smell. The rooms were so dark and we couldnt differentiate between nite and day."
1042,I reserved a superior room for one night through the Venere travel agency. When I arrived at the hotel at 2:00A.M.after the 20 hour trip from New York City I was told the hotel was filled and could not stay there. An Iranian Tour operator was also having a problem with arrangements that had been made months before.
1043,"I'm working in India for a couple of weeks and decided to visit Delhi. BCDTravel from India booked the hotel. The place is just terrible. The rooms are very dirty, smells, i even found 10 empty bottles of beer in front of my room when i arrived."
1044,i booked my hotel from the website and i made the payment from ther and i wa scared that the hotel is good enough or not. When i reached the hotel it was like i have paid nothing for the hotel. One difficulty i experienced that was i was that tv cabel was not working for 2 hour or so.
1045,"I should have known when I arrived this place was into fleecing people. I tipped the guy who carried my bags. Later, he hunted me down because the bill was 'ripped' The hotel staff honestly seem to think I owe them a booking on some overpriced tour."
1046,"Hotel was full of damp linen. Check In system was horrible. I left the next morning since it was late in the night and staying in a neighbouring much cheaper, but much cleaner hotel."
1047,Stayed there for a week. Great service. Awesome staff! Rooms are 5 star standard. Definitely you will get value for money. I will strongly recommend.
1048,We stayed only one night and our room was close to the reception. All the noise from the hall way and reception could clearly be heard in our room all night. Try to get a room far away from the reception and/or wear earplugs.
1049,"Staff areexcellent and very helpful, whilst the attached restaurant has excellent food and service. Rooms are variable in size but well appointed for us. Only trouble with the hotel is that there is no lounge area for friends to meet."
1050,"Greeting was pleasant, room was small but clean and well appointed. Restaurant was excellent. Location was so central for that part of Delhi."
1051,The staff were very attentive and our room was exceptionally clean. It was also quiet which was great as it was daylight when we finally got to sleep. The hotel was also kind enough to store one of our bags for a week.
1052,Hotel Palace Heights in New Delhi has a high rating on TripAdvisor. We booked the hotel through hotels.com (expedia.in) through which we booked this hotel for 2 nights. Our booking confirmation from hotels .com came through and my husband's credit card was charged the full amount. We arrived at the front desk of the hotel palace heights at 10 pm at night to be met with bewilderment. They saw our booking confirmation and said that they had not received any booking. They said that it must have been hotels. com's fault as they had NOT RECEIVED ANY BOOKING! We were left in a dilemma as to where to spend the night. We eventually did manage to find an overpriced and badly located hotel later that night but our trip had been ruined by our experience.
1053,"The rooms inside are great, with a modern and clean decor, flat panel TV, and a lovely bathroom. The location is perfectly central, there are loads of shops, restaurants, and ATMs when you step out of the hotel. The food in the restaurant, Zaffran, is wonderful, and the service in there is also exemplary."
1054,"Location is perfect and rooms were very clean and comfortable. Bathroom was immaculate. Restaurant is also fabulous. Free wireless Internet service. Parking on the streets, free of charge."
1055,"The Hotel is very central. The room we had was clean and we were able to sleep 3 in the room. It is an expensive hotel, but worth it for the restaurant and its central position."
1056,Great location right in the heart of Connaught Place and close to the metro station. Restaurant is great at both breakfast and dinner (some of the best food I've ever had in India) Rooms are well appointed and confortable.
1057,We stayed for 3 nights in late June and then for one night in early July. The hotel was modern and very clean. The AC worked very well and it was a good escape from the very hot temps outside. Rooms were on the small side and there isn't much of a lobby.
1058,"I stayed end of august (29.08.09) in this hotel in Delhi - and it was simply perfect!!! You can't ask for a nicer, welcoming service. Connaught place is in the very heart of Delhi, the rooms are comfortable, have European standard."
1059,"Palace Heights is a quiet oasis in the heart of Delhi, with clean rooms furnished in a contemporary design style. The restaurant is one of the best I tried in India, cozy and relaxing."
1060,We could hear incessant banging in the first TWO rooms they put us in. They also pressured us into using their travel agent for a tour to the Taj Mahal. The car and driver was over priced and had barely working A/C.
1061,"We stayed two nights at Hotel Palace Height. The hotel is expensive for the size of the room &amp; bathroom. On our first night we had no hot water, but the hotel staff fixed that quickly."
1062,"The hotel is small, but very well kept, and clean. The food in Zaffran is excellent... the breakfast is to order, and always prepared very well. The location of the hotel is superb. Right above the Metro station which makes traveling around Delhi a breeze."
1063,"We stayed at the hotel on two separate occassions. The food and service was one of the best we had in India. We paid $183.00 Cdn through Expedia, not good value."
1064,"The service was excellent, particularly in the restaurant. The rooms are very modern and the bathroom had a good shower. Breakfast is included with the rate and has a good choice and decent buffet."
1065,"The hotel is better than an 'average 3*' rating. The service was good and the rooms are clean, if a little on the small side. The restaurant (attached to the hotel) called Zaffran was very good."
1066,"This was the third hotel we stayed in during our to-ing and fro-ing to Delhi. It was the cheapest (£98 per room per night inc breakfast), the nicest and the best placed hotel of the lot. The staff were great and very helpful. The room was lovely, clean and well equipped."
1067,The hotel is located on the inner circle of connaught place and is on the second floor. Its a small property having 15-18 rooms only. There is a restaurant called Zafran which serves great Indian food and is also a popular among the locals.
1068,"We stayed for two nights at the palace heights and would definately recommend it. The room we stayed in was clean and with all the amenities you would expect, if a little small. The restaurant is excellent at a reasonable price."
1069,Hotel Palace Heights is a Delhi oasis. The rooms are exceptionally clean and well thought out. The restaurant is also great and serves fanatastic food from North India.
1070,"The hotel is small but great, in a very central location. The rooms were fantastic, I can't fault anything wrong with the rooms. The hotel restaurant was also great - I highly recommend it."
1071,"The hotel is in a great location, smack bang in the middle of the shopping area. Breakfast in the Restaurant was lovely - choice of indian, continental or english. This was one of the better hotels we stayed in on our trip."
1072,"This was my second stay at palace heights, and it was just as great as the first one! This is definitely one hotel I would recommend people stay at, everytime you visit delhi. They have an excellent restaurant attached, and althou living in the UAE gives you access to great indian food. Their room service is even more fab, with meals reaching in 10mins!"
1073,Hotel Restaurant Zaffran is located on Connaucht Place. Spacious bedroom and bathroom. Furnishings all-round elegant and in good condition.
1074,The Palace Heights is located on Connaught Square in Delhi. The hotel is on the first floor (there is a lift) which means the rooms are quiet.
1075,"I'm so glad that I had chance to stay in Palace Heights. Palace Heights is an example of successful adaptive re-used building. The location is just perfect, in the center of CP and just a minute walk to fabIndia."
1076,"The hotel is located in a good part of New Delhi, a short walk from shops and parks. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, rooms are very clean and modern. The restaurant is excellent."
1077,"The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, with good recommendations for restaurants in the area. The included fruits, water and breakfast help you get your day off to a good start easily."
1078,The Palace Heights was a real haven away from the bustle of Connaught Place. The food in the Zaffran restaurant was really good and service was also excellent.
1079,"The hotel has been renovated recently and now offers business-style, clean and tidy rooms with spacious beds and a fine bathroom. The restaurant at the hotel offers very good food, the elevated prices (compared to other options outside the hotel) are worth it."
1080,"Stayed at the hotel for a business trip, the rooms were lovely and the staff extremely helpful. Will definitely be staying there for my next trip to Delhi! Highly recommended."
1081,"We stayed here for two nights after arriving in Delhi from the US. Check-in was smooth and though our room was a bit small, it was very comfortable. Breakfast in the hotel was good and very convenient."
1082,"Hotel Palace Heights in Connuaght Place is located in central Delhi. Hotel Palace Heights has a long list of wines, cocktails and all kinds of alcohols being served."
1083,"The hotel is located in the heart of the city (Connaught Place) It is a bit expensive, but you are paying for the location. It is definately cheaper than other hotels around the area."
1084,"The Palace Heights is probably one of the best hotels in Delhi in the moderate price range. The location, rooms, service are great and the restaurant is fantastic."
1085,"North Indian restaurant with 24 hour room service. Central location and good value. No noise from street. Good facilities in room (plasma TV, large bathroom)"
1086,I've booked this hotel via Desiya an Indian website and got a good price. I was a bit concerned as I was going over with my small fella and the wife. It has been a wonderful experience - breakfast was brilliant as they had continental as well as Indian Poori Bhaji which was delicious! As my wife was indisposed for 3 days they made hot chapatis to take into the room and my son enjoyed his cereals. I had my Beer &amp; dinner all days at the hotel and the service was attentive.
1087,"Small hotel in the centre of New Delhi, is close to everything. Recently renovated and although the rooms are small, it has good service, it is clean and quiet (unlike the rest of India). has aircondition (but no heating)."
1088,Hotel Palace Heights is a superb boutique hotel in the heart of Delhi. Exceptional service and friendly staff had us staying at this quiet hotel twice this summer. Spotless rooms and central location.
1089,"Stayed here for a few days arriving in India, and then again one night before shipping back to Europe. The staff is extraordinarily friendly, and the rooms are clean with comfortable beds and have good modern amenities. The only drawback is the lack of pool / SPA."
1090,"The room itself is has a flat screen TV, snacks of fruit and bottled water at no extra charge. Room service is great and it's offered 24 hours a day. The bathroom had beautiful floor to ceiling marble, the shower was large and there was a good supply of hot water."
1091,I stayed in the hotel for two nights &amp; had both the dinners here. The food in the restaurant- Zaffran was really blessings to the tastebuds.
1092,"The room is so small, you feel clostrophobic. The aircondition only has icy cold or really hot. The reception is 20 years old, and have the combined intelligence of a 10 year old. Do not budget travel in Delhi."
1093,"The hotel is located on the second floor of a period building overlooking Connaught Place. The room is clean, functional and 'modern', with mock wooden floors and minimalist furniture, decorations and bathroom. Breakfast was included in the room rate and you can have it either in the restaurant or delivered to your room."
1094,"We stayed 4 nights in this nice hotel very welll located, clean , staff is very nice and helpfull at the reception and in the hotel restaurant The Saffran. They give you every day 2 bottles of water and fruits , newspaper in the morning and on arrival they serve you juice. It is not expensive for New Delhi do not hesitate to book ."
1095,"Just great. Very well located in Connaught Place, great rooms, nice furnished and modern decoration, flat screen tv, nice bathrooms, nice restaurant, very friendly staff. I'll be back."
1096,"The dinner and breakfast room was nice, and the staff very friendly. This is an hotel in the center of Delhi, near the Indian and international shops."
1097,"The restaraunt, Zaffron, is the best thing about this hotel. The menu is great and the prices are about $15 per meal."
1098,"Location: at the heart of the city. you can never ask for a better location.Rooms, Staff, Service, Reception: ExcellentBreakfast: Complimentry and excellent choice of menu."
1099,"Small with 14 rooms, but excellently managed. No queues for check-in or check out as there are only 14 rooms. 24 hour room service @ no extra charge. Good air con / heating .Thick fabric window blinds keep sunlight out."
1100,"I shared a room with two friends. The manager confirmed via email that we would have the room for six nights before we paid our deposit. On arrival they told us we will only have a room for three nights. The rooms are well furnished as expected for the price that they charge, and service is prompt."
1101,"No one met us on arrival at IGIA to take us to the hotel, even though we had previously booked the transfer and re-confirmed prior to arrival. The hotel claims someone was there, and we just didn't see him. Complimentary wi-fi access in the rooms worked perfectly."
1102,"stayed 1 night, extremely helpful staff, clean modern room, good restaurant, a sanctuary in the middle of delhi, very near excellent metro system station."
1103,The staff are friendly and alway willing to help you. The rooms are fitted with a plasma screen tv and mini bar. There is also a railway near by.
1104,This is a really good hotel to arrive to in delhi. Staff were very nice even though there were too many knocks on the door for one thing or another. Clean and comfortable but the towels were old and grey!
1105,The Hotel Palace Heights is certaintly excellent value for a stay in central Delhi. Full of nice touches - complimentary fruit bowl &amp; chocolates on arrival - the best hotel soaps and lotions I have ever used. The rooms *are* small (as is the hotel) so I would not book for an extended stay.
1106,The Palace Heights was recently re-furbished in preparation for the 2010 Commonwealth Games. The restaurant was packed with locals which is always a huge recommendation. The hotel fits the bill for those not wanting to pay 5 star Delhi prices.
1107,"Hotel Palace Heights is in the heart of Connaught Place. The attached restaurant, Zaffran, is delicious. The food is safe and clean and really excellent. The service matches the food and decor."
1108,"This hotel is in Connaught Place, section D. Room was small but had everything you needed, reminded me of a Marriott hotel back home. Plasma TV on wall, coffee &amp; tea facilities."
1109,Hotel Palace Heights in New Delhi was recommended by Lonely Planet. Double room cost 5500Rs + 12.5% tax including breakfast. Service was reasonable without being fabulous.
1110,Hotel Palace Heights is a great hotel in a great situation in Delhi. Staff were lovely and the level of service was amazing. The room was small but very nicely furnished although there were no views.
1111,"Staff were very friendly, courteous and attentive throughout my 2 night stay. The room was not particularly large, but had a big bed, flat screen tv, and immaculate marble bathroom with large shower. The restaurant is also excellent, serving very tasty and good value Indian food."
1112,Palace heights is an excellent hotel at a great location. Close to the metro from where you can explore the whole city. Rooms are clean and everything works.
1113,This Hotel is located in CP in Delhi. Simply VOW... I think its a boutique hotel. Room rent was around Rs 4500/= for single room.
1114,Stayed here with friends as a hub in and out of New Delhi. Hotel arranged car service to/from the int'l airport and to the Taj Mahal the next morning.
1115,"This place is perfect if you are interested in keeping the costs down, while also enjoying a clean and safe room. The frinedly and pleasant staff fulfilled all our requests, and they arranged drivers, and guides who took us to the Taj M."
1116,"My boyfriend, two friends, and I stayed at this hotel for two nights. Vishal from the Pearl Plaza was by far the most responsive. The hotel was very clean and the staff was very helpful."
1117,"Located in Paharganj, metro station (Rama Krishna) is 2min walk, plenty of dirt and beggars. New Delhi railway station is super close and a ride with a rickshaw should be no more than 40-50 rupees."
1118,"We stayed at Pearl Plaza in Paharganj, Delhi for 2 nights in the middle of May 2009. Here is a summary of our impressions from the Pearl Plaza."
1119,"I was travelling with a group of friends and we decided to stay at this place. Big mistake. We booked far in advance, but they managed to book us one room to few. The rooms were dirty, pokey and noisy."
1120,"Location is good. It's quite close to the metro and it's very close to a nice shopping street. Rooftop restaurant is nice, they serve food that's quite ok."
1121,"Not a good place to stay! The room was dirty, the bathtub was stained and they use moth balls in the sinks which end up smelling up the entire room. Service was really weird. There are much nicer neighbourhoods in Delhi - don't stay here!"
1122,"Location is good, close to a lot of shopping and the metro station. The staff were extremely helpful, the porters and reception staff were able to help us with any of our questions. The rooms were clean and comfortable."
1123,"The hotel was booked by a travel agent and for the price they charged, I expected much much better. The floor was dirty, bathrooms were wet..i was disgusted. Dont know about food and restarant quality as I decided not to eat there after I saw the rooms."
1124,"Staff were delightful and helpful. Room was OK, not dirty. Did not use the restaurant so can't comment on it. Do not use this hotel if you are looking for luxury!!"
1125,"Food was not up to our expectations, but ok ( since this is a budget hotel). Rooms were clean &amp; tidy enough. Bathroom was clean and ok. Remember to bring bottled water along with you."
1126,Don't go to this hotel people they will try to rip you off after you've seen how dirty and cheap the rooms are. They have one suite and they put these photos on the net.Absolute misguidance.
1127,"Strang, strange hotel. Far from perfect..Booked by a travel agent through this tour we did. By far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in."
1128,"It was perfect. nice room, cheap price, and especially the staffs. we will definitely stay in this Hotel Prince International again. It was perfect, nice room and cheap price."
1129,Decided to try this place after reading the two previous positive reviews which I am suspicious of their origin as our experience was not great. Our room smelt like a sewer and was right next to the noisy lift shaft which kept going all night. Our bed was damp which in Feb is not great as it is cold. You are at the mercy of this hotel once you arrive so be careful.
1130,"Comfortable, well priced, and very clean. Nice staff, and a good internet connection. They even pickup from the airport. Would stay here again."
1131,"Hotel Prince International is located near the Karol Bagh Market. It is close to several nice restaurants like Alpha Spice, Raffles (great thali) and Crossroads."
1132,"I stayed at the hotel on two ends of a trip to Nepal and India in August to early September. I found the room clean and comfortable and, as a single woman traveler, felt very safe there. Its location off the main street meant it wasn't as noisy as some."
1133,"I visited their hotel and chosen super deluxe, I went to shop in Paharganj. When i back and saw that my expensive camera was lost. I asked the Manager to call the police but they denied to Call and miss behaved with me."
1134,The hotel itself is fairly grotty and basic. We mainly chose it for the location near the station and the pool. Both of which turned out to be extremely dirty and horrible. Didn't feel at all safe.
1135,"Prince Polonia is on a quiet street (quiet by India standards) but only seconds from all the hustle and bustle you need. The rooms are clean, large and quiet (worth paying a little extra for the deluxe, try room 401 on the roof top)"
1136,The hotel is central and the staff are helpful. The room we had was OK only but the rooftop restaurant was a bonus. The street was not quiet when we stayed there so I'd pack earplugs just in case!
1137,"We chose Hotel Prince Polonia for its close proximity to the New Delhi train station, its affordable rates and the good reviews it got from Lonely Planet authors and other travellers. The only thing that bothered us was that they never returned our passports to our room as promised."
1138,"The rooms were clean, the location central, the majority of the staff helpful and the food palatable. The manager (the son of the owner I believe) is a miserable git to the extreme and has a habit of speaking to his staff as though they are scum. If you're going to stay here make sure you spend a little more and get a better room."
1139,"I made the reservation by email and called to confirm before I traveled. The staff was helpful, they let us check in early since the room was ready. It was a little pricy compared to the rest of the hotels in the area, but it was clean."
1140,Hotel was ranked so high on trip advisor I thought I'd give it a try. The room itself was not clean. Broken wall fixtures. Dirty bathrooms. Piles of dirt and dust behind and under the bed didn't make me feel safe to let my young kids play.
1141,"This place was clean and the staff were helpful. Rooms are basic biut comfy with a tv and air con. The rooftop Restaurant is lovely, breakfast is included in the price."
1142,"Had a super deluxe room, which was comfortable and quiet enough for a good sleep and it's pretty spacious. Staff were mostly helpful, except for one missing wake-up call, so as the attached travel agent."
1143,Delhi hotels are generally pretty expensive and Parharganj is about the cheapest area to stay in. It's also very handy for New Delhi railway station when you want to move on.
1144,"Hotel was just fine, no problems, room was clean&amp; bright, staff were courteous. Maybe a little expensive but it's a good idea to have somewhere like this booked before arriving in delhi."
1145,"The Hotel RAK International has a roof-top restaurant staffed by ethnic (Asiatic) Nepalese who answer to the cool reception dude with the moustache. For a fraction of the restaurant price, I suggest you wander down Main Bazaar rd and sample the foods that the locals come for such as fresh lassi and samosa’s."
1146,"I loved this hotel. it was perfect. nice room, cheap price, and especially the staff. they were all very nice and very helpful. if i go back to new delhi, i will definitely stay in this hotel again."
1147,"We paid 750 rupees for a double room with A/C and en-suite bathroom. There was no breakfast included. Staff were friendly enough, and not that bothered when we told them we were moving out!"
1148,"stayed at hotel rak international twice recently whilst in delhi and liked it very much. it's basic as are most budget hotels in the area but i love paharganj and it's bussle, and my room was quiet and clean."

1151,Our stay was fine there. Their tour assistance was good. We appreciate these guidance given for our trip. We would like to thank them for their guidance.
1152,We stayed in two hotels in Delhi before picking up this hotel. Theworst about those hotels was the uneducated and useless staff. Here isthis hotel I found people with great knowledge.

1156,"We are an old age couple and our third time to india. Hotel is good. Wi-fi, lobby and restaurant are few of the good things in the hotel."
1157,We were very disappointed with this hotel. I have stayed in Delhi three times before at better hotels for the same price. The restaurant in the Raunak was fairly but at the other two hotels owned by the same man the food was dreadful.
1158,If you don't want to spend more and want value for your money this hotel is worth staying. Best point is the location and informative staff.
1159,"We booked the hotel dirctlily via email. They did not charge any money for advance booking. The bed is really comfortable, matress are so soft and good. Breakfast were served nicely ( I liked parta)."
1160,We booked from malasiya directly with the hotel on our friend’s recommendation. They sent a good taxi for pick up and same nice taxi to show us Agra and Jaipore. Staff is polite and helpful.
1161,We booked five rooms in hotel Raunak International in delhi. When they came to know marriage anniversary. They organized our party for us and presented us with a beautiful chocolate cake. Such a good hotel.

1164,"Large rooms, free internet on my laptop, flat screen TV’s in lobby andin room, DVD was provided to us free of cost. A good holiday wasplanned to Agra &amp; Jaipur by the manager and he gave us his own car."

1183,"The hotel was ok, although no hot water and a shower glass panel sitting in the bath wasn't ideal. The general customer service was very, very poor. Room service kept knocking on our door and rang us whilst we were sleeping to give us food/drink that we hadn't even ordered."
1184,Hotel raunak international is a leading economy hotel. It is a convenient place for family and holiday travelers offering personalized services in your budget.

1210,Great place to stay whether for business or pleasure. This hotel is very close to a large market area and a quick autorickshaw ride to everywhere else in Delhi.
1211,The hotel has free Wi-Fi in every room and the speed was enough for surfing newspapers with my laptop. But for YouTube and Skype I had to move up to the also free business-centre on the top floor.
1212,Staying at Hotel Raunak was truely MEMORABLE. The hotel staff is very friendly. My visits to Jaipur and Agra was also made easy and taken care by the tour services provided by the hotel.
1213,The room is comfortable and the beds are super comfy. The service of the staff is exceptional and they go out of their way to cater to your needs. The hotel is also well located in the heart of delhi.
1214,Kishan Singhania was so much impressed from the hosipitality. After entering in the room i was feeling very good and comfortable. Everything was just wonderful.
1215,Hotel Rounak is the best areound all Indai which are having any kind facilities for day and night. The value of stay there is cheapest then other hotel. All facilities are avilable there.
1216,my room was very comfy. i like their matteress . room service too good and quick. they provide good food at reasonable price. nonveg was osum. best part for this hotel is its location . u can reach any major part of city very easily. metro station is too close.
1217,Hotel staff had helped me very much to guide about delhii because i was totaaly straneg for thsi city. Keep it up hotel mangaemnt and staff......
1218,"hi, to all, good day,this hotel is superb mind blowing, every features and facilities are really terrific, i m very glad to see this hotel in delhi, it brings full stop in search for celebrating the any occasion with friends, family etc."
1219,Rounak is the best hotel in new delhi with best location and for best value. Hotel staff is very good and very helpfull. Food is very tasty with real taste of india. this is smart choice for smart people.
1220,"The rooms are excellent, very clean, very good services...Actual value to the money being spend. I am sure this can be one of the best hotel that anyone can find in and around Delhi."
1221,"When we reached there our worst nightmare was about to begin. We went up to the room to see it first...There we saw the worst room. The bedsheet was an old and dirty one and the room was dusty. We started to say that we cannot stay in that room. They showed us another room which was equally bad. We called up our friend in Delhi and explained our situation. He told us to just leave the hotel immediately. We sitted in the lobby about half an hour waiting for our friend to come and pick us up. When we were about to leave,the receptionist asked us to pay RS 2000."
1222,i loved my stay in india and specially in this hotel as it is very clean and serves good exotic indian food. It is located centrally so my time was not wasted and i booked my trip to agra and jaipur from this hotel itself.
1223,The hotel is located in a vibrant neighbourhood near the metro station. The rooms themselves were tidy and clean. The bathrooms could use some redecorating.
1224,"i had good service in raunak hotel all employment were very intelligent and helpful.rooms were very clean ,they cleaned it every day,restaurant was good with indian spicy food , i could have many choices."
1225,"India is historical Place and good for enjoyment, sightseeing and shopping. i have visited india before also but after i found raunak international hotel my coming to india and my trip was more enjoyable and easy. followings are positive points of the hotel."
1226,"i email contact to stay with this hotel during 6-14 June with my partners. when i arrive the hotel, they got only 2 guests in the hotel and when i see the room. i was shock coz the hotel is actually under renovating and it's dusty everywhere! you can put your finger on counter or floor, they never clean it. when the guy try to open the curtain for me, the whole curtain fell down! i was really upset and tired and i tell the them that i can accept this and i want to move the hotel. they charge me 1 night for RS 1,800 even i didn't stay. they also charge me taxi pick up from airport for RS 550 which at the front of their website said 'provide free pickup from airport' and they charge us another RS1,000 to get our from their hotel to somewhere else. i seriously upset and speechless from this hotel. it was nightmare and disgusting. you will never ever see anything worst than this."
1227,Hotel's website photos are a lie. Our room was tiny and had no windows. Staff's English is poor. Several times during our stay there was no water and so the toilet wouldn't flush.
1228,I had a great time staying at this hotel. Started my travels through India with ease and I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends!
1229,Raunak became my home away from home. I was picked up at the airport as planned. Staff really extended themselves to make sure I had everything I needed.
1230,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 days. The staff is friendly and very helpful. A very good place to stay. A home, away from home."
1231,"The best Hotel in Delhi!! very clean , hot water, TV in English. The food and the service was very good!For sure if i recomended Raunak International if yoyu need excelent hote and good price, Absolutely the best hotel in Delhi !!Tanks!Adriana (Mexico)"
1232,"The hotel is located in Karol Bagh close to the Metro station (Rs.8 to Counaught Place, Rs.16 to Central Secretariat). The hotel is clean with friendly staff and an owner (Mr Singh) that takes care of a personal interest in the needs of his guests."
1233,"The area is close to the center, with a metro station and lots of shops nearby. It doesn't look like areas in western cities, but it is a good place to stay."
1234,"The hotel is located in a lively neighbourhood with a lot of good restaurants, markets and all a backpacker needs. The owner is very friendly and hospitable."
1235,"We stayed in this hotel for two days and this place is werth for the amount u paid. clean place, with all 3 star aminities. food they served also good . the staff is friendly. nice place to stay, if we are going to delhi again we will definitely stay in this."
1236,The staff spoke very bad English and had great difficulty understanding me. Hot water was only available for a few hours in the morning. Most of the electrical outlets in my room did not work. The exhaust fan didnt work in the bathroom and the armoire smelled of mold.
1237,"My first trip to India. May not be my last, but my last to Delhi and Northern India. Stayed two nights. Friends made reservations. Had I known about upgrade rooms I would have insisted on one."
1238,"Arrived at hotel late pm after 6 hour drive from Agra. Lobby clean and quite and impressive compared to surroundings. Room average, air-con and TV worked but strong air freshener smell which turned out to be the insect repellent device in the bathroom."
1239,"when we arrived we were given a room that resembled a dungeon. we complained and were assured that a better room would be given on our return 3 weeks later. it was better, but not much. make sure you see all type of rooms. silver is smaller but much better."
1240,"my frnds booked this place for me as i hv been living in Petersburg since last 5 yrs. stayed here for 5 nights, before shifting to myfrnds place. everything, the t.v , gyser nd ac , all worked fine. the breakfast buffet was grand and offered me many options. overall a nice place."
1241,"i had my engagement on 30th of oct. and the arrangements were made by regent continental in their hall. we enjoyed alot a night before and all thanks to these people, they made sitting arrangement for all of our extended family and us to play games in the night in their banquet hall and that too complimentary !! whole night we all kept odering snacks , tea and all and the service throughout was excellent.thanks to all!!!"
1242,"i visited delhi in march 2009 n stayed in hotel regent continental for 4 days before i went ahead to jaipur. It was a good experience for a first timmer to india. India is a good country,the people are also very nice."
1243,I am staying in Bangalore. I would like to share the experience of my delhi stay which part of jaipur trip. We reached quite late night in Delhi. Booked this hotel through internet. And to our pleasure we were received by the reception with a warm smile.
1244,i visited this hotel in march 2009 as some of my colleagues were comming in from the US. Since their visit was only for 3 days and they wanted to do some shopping as well so i decided to put them in a hotel in the heart of the city.By the end of the stay all my guests were very happy with room service as well as the staff courtesy.
1245,"stayed here on our tour of northen india, by far the worst hotel.rooms were very small and dated.service and food were very poor and breakfast was worrying as food was kept,well, warm."
1246,"Noisy at all hours of day and night; in the middle of the night you could hear staff shouting and talking loudly and dogs barking incessantly outside. Room dirty, asked to change the room we were given cause the shower was filthy, second room wasn't much better. In the end they also claimed that we hadn't paid something (false) and receptionists started shouting and cursing against us."
1247,"The hotel is situated in a rundown, dirty and overcrowded area. Our room was too small to swing a cat in. It was situated internally within the building so had no outside window. A small window overlooked a shaft reminiscent to a coal mine shaft. The bathroom was disguising, ancient and filthy."
1248,The Hotel is well maintaines with clean hygenic rooms. Located in the centre of Karol Bagh close to the Delhi Metro station which makes moving about easier and fast.
1249,The hotel is located in a very narrow street in Karol Bagh area of Delhi. It is a 3 * hotel with 5* service. The restaurant in the hotel is ok. The furnishing and lighting is pleasing but themenu can be improved.
1250,"We arrived @ 10pm our room was on the 1st floor. very bad ,smelling room. After complaining we were upgraded to the 2nd floor. Still not happy. Will not go back."
1251,I stayed in this hotel with 2 colleagues for a week in September. The room looked nice but lacked finishing. The bathroom had a shower with no curtain and modern looking wash basin.
1252,"Beware of Checking in this Hotel. Despite our Advance Payment, while checkin had to wait for 45 minutes just to complete Formalities. No room allotment planning despite 3 rooms were booked. Pathatic food, Water was leaking from cieling... in monsoon... Hostile and rought staff."
1253,"I stayed at the Regent Contenental for 4 nights in January 2008. Even from the start, I should have known better. The noise is almost unbelievable. The floors are so dirty that you have to wear shoes all the time."
1254,Staff either choose to speak no english or are just quite surly. The hardest thing to grasp is that when you ask a question they will lie to your face trying to get you in their cafe.
1255,"I booked this through a travel agent (Travel Zone, India) in Feb. 2007. It was noisy, dirty, and overpriced. When I came back in August to Delhi, my new agent tried to book this place again for me telling me that my other choice (Clark International, 1 block away) was a far inferior choice. The agent's office is within blocks of both. I stayed at the Clark."
1256,"The hotel was horrendously noisy well past midnight till 1 am or later. From our room, we could hear incessantly the loud slamming of doors. We also encountered problems with the shower, whereby we could barely coax out a trickle of hot water."
1257,"The state of the rooms was DISGUSTING with dead mosquitos on the bed linen, floor, bathroom etc. The staff are basically 14-16 year old boys who go around in groups of 2-4 who stand around waiting for tips. The location of this hotel is in the most awaful place you can imagine, it is surrounded by gangs, beggers, loud barking dogs."
1258,"I visited the hotel to meet someone who was there (I had also read the reviews posted here previously on the same hotel when I was looking for a place.)The Lobby Area looks empty. As indicated by another visitor on this site, they may advise visitors to take 'their&quot; taxi service. The Taxi Service is run by a separate unit (In the lobby) and the hotel staff do not coordinate with this unit in a satisfactory manner."
1259," breakfast is a typical indian breakfast. we got food poisoning whilst here, but that could have been what we ate out. when we came ill the stafF were very helpful and friendly with great service. the rooms are spacious with airt con-but this is very noisey. in a decent location, very bustling! would not go again."
1260,"Checked in, stayed for an hour then checked out again. The bathroom had no running water, there was scum, mould and anything else which was vile growing on the bath and tiles. The coridoors were dark and dingy. It was truely appaling."
1261,"The hotel is overbooking people and then transfering them to smaller, 0 star hotels in the vicinity (they have special arrangements with them) We were lied to by both the manager and the co-owner of the hotel and after two days of fighting, squabling and hell, we finally never got our room."
1262,"Muztapher is a travel agent who arranges flights, cars and hotels. We had three nights here, the first night the room was dark with no windows and cramped. The second time we checked in we asked for a room with a window at the front."
1263,"My wife and I stayed here last month for 4 nights. The rooms are not great, the bathrooms are awful. There are much better options in New Delhi, however, they are way more expensive."
1264,"We stayed there twice in tiny rooms with small windows opening to the next wall. One room was in the reach of strolling cats. The rooms were dumpy, even with the AC on and had a bad smell. Room and bathroom were basic and not clean."
1265,Overall we found the service and facilities of the hotel adequate. The big problem was the rooms. We stayed in this hotel twice during one trip to India and both rooms we found to be very dark (no windows) and small. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
1266,"The location is average, hidden down a back alley but not too far from the excellent metro system. The room service was good, the wait was not too long and the food was of an acceptable standard, as was the price. My biggest gripe was the level of service provided by the staff."
1267,On arrival a staff member tried to downgrade us from a double regent suite to a classic deluxe room. They wanted to charge more for the suite even though we had agreed on a price. We demanded the original room at the set price and they gave it to us without further quibble. Room service was awful as they brought things we didn't order.
1268,We stayed at the Regent Continental Hotel in New Delhi after booking online. We experienced many problems. Service from staff at reception was poor. Pressure was put on us to use expensive hotel taxis instead of local transport.
1269,"My room was large, open and spacious with a balcony, refrigerator, large beds and a nice large bath room. The hotel staff went out of their way to be accommodating and all were so kind and friendly. This was my first trip to Delhi but if I have an opportunity to return it will definitely be to the same place."
1270,"First impression wasn't good, as the ac, tv , gyser and bathroom lights of the room i was given wasn't working. However they fixed it within an hour. Apart from that there was no problem. we booked taxis and delhi sight seeing through the hotel's tarvel desk which was fantastic. Would love to stay there again."
1271,"If requiring any services please ask the staff as they can point you in any direction. Whether it be leather, fabric they will help you. Transport to where ever organized efficiently and on time."
1272,"I book this hotel through Expedia, my credit card was deducted yet no confirmation from Hotel. Wrote many email to Expedia &amp; hotel, no reply from anyone. Any one can advice what to do next?"
1273,"for india it was a little pricey,but that shouldnt take away the fact its in a good location. The rooms are clean and they offer a pick up service from the airport which helps to avoid any early stress."
1274,"Hotel is near a construction site. Non professional staff, dusts in the room, a filthy place to stay. i can't recommend to anybody who can pay at least 25$ a night. Book at your risk."
1275,"Breakfast could become better with some fruit as well. Mr.Chauhan at the frontdesk is ok helpfull, and organizing whats needed."
1276,"I booked this via hotels.com for 1330rs a night, inclusive of tax. reception was very dowdy, felt like a step back to late 80s. room itself was fairly small, just about fit the double bed. AC was clunky but worked."
1277,"This hotel was a good fit for my son and I. We arrived at 2:30 am after being picked up at the airport. Manager helped us chart our trip. Clean and large, quiet room."
1278,I stayed at Hotel Royal Holidays for three nights and i found the hotel very nice. The hotel has excellent staff who takes good care of you and they make sure that you get everything on time. The most significant thing about the hotel is its close proximity to the metro station and the restaurant.
1279,"We had an awful holiday in this hotel. The staff was not professional and they even tried to cheat us many times. When they didn't get us as many tips as they wanted, they tried to cancel our connection way to the Agra. It was scary and very unpleasant. So we left this place before our check-out date. And - of course - we didn't getting anything back."
1280,"this hotel is good hotelbath,toilet,bed clean good sleeping very safety hotel staff very honest i recomend to all japanase tourist student or family visit here very cheap and good hotel."
1281,"The company of the one that I mention is, ABYSS TOURS AND My representative is Mr ARIF. I can recommend this to everyone, because they are trust worthy and generous. The company that myself this representing and the hotel where I lodge of the same signs they are excellent."
1282,I stayed in this hotel in the month of June with my wife well i booked online and use there free pickup services in the begining i was not sure about my booking and free pickup but defeintly everything works very well. i wouldl receomnd thsi hotel for any type of Tourist.
1283,"I agree with bad responses. Besides deceive with payment. Have reserved and have paid for other hotel, and have lodged in this and have forced to pay the second time. Do not contact ?siativ.com and a travel agent Arif who works with this hotel."
1284,Hotel Royal Holidays is a short taxi or metro ride from Connaught Place. The hotel is just a block away from tons of shopping in Karol Bagh.
1285,"We really enjoyed our stay here the welcome and airport pick up made a really smooth and pleasant transition when very jet lagged. We could not have been better looked after better by the staff ,breakfast was delicious! Arif was great helped us find our way round and deal with any difficulties."
1286,"According to the booking by Expedia airport pick-up was included. The hotel had been notifyed about flight number and arrival time. The double rooms we got the first night were disappointing, to say the least."
1287,"I booked this hotel through the Thank You Points website after reading some posiitive reviews in Trip Advisor. Our stay of 3 nights was very comfortable and as we were interested in shopping, the shopping area was down the street from the Hotel. Karol Bagh is the best place for bargain hunters."
1288,"I stayed at this hotel mid Jan for one night and couldn't get out of the place fast enough! There were no towels in our room, we had to ask for them twice. The Room was dark and gloomy as it had no windows and the wardrobe doors were jammed closed."
1289,"Hotel Royal Holidays was clean enough but the room was very expensive for what it was. We were paying around 1400Rs for a very basic room without a window which was often smelly. The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful on the whole, however ignore any help they offer in hiring a taxi."
1290,Stayed here at the start and end of our trip... rooms are ok but as with everything in Delhi well overpriced for what you get. Biggest let down for us was the unhelpful nature of the staff. Every question i asked resulted in them trying to make money off us.
1291,"We booked one night in this hotel, but when we arrived they said that another guest had missed their flight, and they would have to put us up in another hotel. Still, the area was fine, handy for anywhere you might want, and near the metro if you don't want to risk your skin in an auto."
1292,Hotel Royal Holidays is a clean and very confortable hotel. It has spacious rooms and clean bathrooms. The service here is excellent . For the price we paid we got a really good deal.
1293,Like others I chose this hotel only because of its good reviews. Reality was hard to accept. It is more like hostel than hotel. Room was quite ok but bathroom was horrible. Cockroaches in my bed were disgusting.
1294,"Hotel was in a decent location, within walking distance of the metro, but just too hard to find. shower had this strange radio which freaked me out when it turned on suddenly, good hot water if you turn on the heater. breakfast was standard with a few indian dishes, bread, and eggs."
1295,"Hotel is a fake, we booked here because it was 7th on the ranking, and when I think about the horrible night we passed there I cannot understand how can has that score. At the end of the day 20£ for a couple one night you get what you pay a dump place. The staff is completely useless, with no manners at all, and since you step into the hotel no matter about your long flight they start trying to con you with all sort of crap deals. We checked out early next morning as we had to take a train to Jaipur, and there were people sleeping on the stairs."
1296,Hotel is central to Delhi and the shopping is just within walking distance. There is a medical centre just next door and lots of restaurants nearby. Rooms are big and affordable even for a budget traveller.
1297,Hotel Royal holidays is a good place to stay in delhi. Room is good but they have to clean room daily. Hot water is also a big problem in the hotel.
1298,Hotel Royal Holidays is in the Karol Bagh area of Delhi. The location is the best thing about this hotel. The room itself was dirty by my standards so I didn't take my shoes off.
1299,"This hotel is located in a quiet section of the city a $1-$2 auto rickshaw ride from everywhere. There are many restaurants and shops within a block or two. The service is quite good, and the staff is very helpful and accommodating."
1300,It was our first time in India and we were so scared as we been heard many things about the touts at the airport. We were greeted at the Airport with a hotel taxi driver who drove very safely in the night and drop us off at the hotel. We found the Hotel reception welcoming always during our stay.
1301,"Room was also good - if you like with window, better ask for it. We booked via Expedia. There was a guy at the reception named Sajad who gave us a free taxi ride TO the airport."
1302,This is my second time in India in last year I have booked hotel Suncity from Expedia I was not so happy because room size was very small there was no restaurant unfortunately we have to take breakfast in our room. I have stayed there 3 nights it was wonderful experience I really highly recommend this hotel.
1303,"Hotel Royal Holidays is located in Karol Bagh, Delhi. Rooms are clean with huge beds, private bathroom with shower and television, including towels and sheets. The staff are very friendly and help with any queries."
1304,We are two girls from sweden that has stayed in the royal holidays hotel in new delhi. We first stayed for 1 night and then a week later we stayed for another 2 nights. The room is comfortable and the service is really nice.
1305,Very Good hotel reasonable price good location safe for single women travellers have no problem to recomended Staff is very friendly also i use there free pickup services again no complains.
1306,We enjoyed the hotel and stayed for about 3 days in two separate stages. good value and excellent location. The staff and front counter staff were very helpful and were able to help with a range of requests.
1307,"For a reasonably priced hotel, this really felt like a luxury experience. This hotel is very closed to India Gate and other major tourist places."
1308,"This Hotel is always my choice when ever I have to stay very near to the Airport. The Rooms are so well managed, that I love to stay in them. I would recommend you all that if you are looking for a budget hotel, then do visit this place."
1309,"The service was a mix: when I checked in, evenso I arrived after 11pm, the service was very friendly, quick and efficient. The next day, the reception was quite unfriendly and agressive."
1310,Nice clean rooms. Tad expensive but I booked thru IRCTC website and got an allinclusive rate.Though IRCTc did not mention free B/F they gave it.
1311,"If you want to have a meeting close to airport, Hotel Shanti palace is the right choice. Its has nice big rooms and tasty restaurent. Though its a bit expensive but its worth to sat there."
1312,The hotel overlooks a busy flyover route into Delhi. The area around the hotel is particularly grotty and nondescript. We would not recommend staying here for any other reason than to be close to the airport.
1313,Shanti Palace is a great hotel if you just need a place to sleep for a night or two. It is located less than 5 minutes from the airport with optional driver pick-up service for about 600 rupees one way. Breakfast is included at the Tripti Restaurant &amp; Bar downstairs.
1314,"A delayed connecting flight made us miss a 1 AM flight from the Delhi Airport. We stayed in the Shanti Palace for 2 nights and were very pleased with the hotel. At $155 per night, we thought we received good value for our money."
1315,"Meet and greet from staff is very poor. Do not understand English. Reception staff stopped serving me, snatched the guest book and started to serve an American Guest. I did get very offended by this and told him on the face."
1316,OK and clean. Has restaruant ok. We got a deluxe suite where we stayed with our two young daughters.Better take a room not facing the highway (noise)
1317,I cannot agree with some bad comments made on this Hotel. The facilities offered are reasonable for Business travellers. The views out of the window may not be a worry for such travellers.
1318,"I stayed a single night at the Shanti Palace and found the hotel to be a very poor hotel. To register for a room, you must sign a registration book that is straight out of the 18th century. The single beds are extremely small. I would never return to this hotel!"
1319,"Hotel seems to have been recently refurbished. Rooms are small but clean. Price on their website was Rs4600, we were charged Rs6600. Reasonably close to airport."
1320,"This is a hotel in the middle of nowhere, next to the airport. The staff is extremely rude. The restaurant in the hotel is extremely expensive, roughly 4 times the normal New Delhi prices."
1321,We were three women that shared a good size room for three nights. The hotel was safe and very clean and that was the most important thing to us. Friendly staff. Food was good.
1322,The best thing about hotel Singh Sahib is its location very near to the Karol Bagh main market and metro station. The rooms were small and bathroom even smaller. This place is only recommended for individual stay for 1-2 days in Delhi.
1323,Hotel is very near to the famous Karol Bagh market. Its a five minute walk to the shopping area. The hotel is located in a nearby side lane thats not too posh.
1324,"I would highly recommend NOT staying at this hotel when you're in Delhi. It was our very first stop after flying in and probably the least welcoming hotel I've ever stayed in. Staff were rude and always yelled at each other, with the noise echoing right up the stairwell. Our room was tiny and dark, with no window and an overflowing toilet."
1325,"If you absolutely must stay here, at all costs avoid room T-2. It's on the top floor and shares a wall with the kitchen, which means you will hear chopping, clanging, and crashing all night long. The rooms are still dirty and uncomfortable."
1326,Location of the hotel is pretty near the sky train station. The room is quite small. There is no chair inside the room. Air ventilation is bad.
1327,We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights in December. The hotel is a midrange hotel ( paid Rs. 2200). Our room was clean and spacious enough to accomodate our family of two adults and one child.
1328,Hotel Metro Heights is right next door to the Singh Sahib hotel. The hotel looked new and they were still renovating a little. There was no mini bar in the room.
1329,"Not bad, but the rooms are very small - not enough space to manouvre between the bed and the TV. The air conditioning only worked in the rooms, and was incredibly noisy and smelly. Not enough towels (problem in most hotels in India). Cable TV, yummy room service, but porters hang around until they get a tip."
1330,"Stayed here with smallish tour party of 13. Room itself was fine, comfortable and spacious although dark. A notice on the door said hot water had to be requested in advance, but we ignored this."
1331,Stayed here in Jan 2008 and was overall a pretty average experience. Room was reasonably clean with hot water in shower but it was freezing cold(about 2c)with no heating in the room at all.
1332,Stayed there at the start of a tour of northern India. Hotel had been organised by tour company so we had no choice. Rooms were dull and dark - as was most of the hotel. Hot water has to be ordered in advance and the sheets and towels are dirty.
1333,"Stayed for 7 days, very cold outside 10 degress and inside 18, could not pay with creditcards ??? only cash, bad exchangerates ! very noisy at the room from the other guest and staff."
1334,"This hotel was good - not amazing, not bad either. The rooms were clean, bathrooms adequate, breakfast edible and hotel staff were helpful. For a 3 star hotel in Delhi I feel it is good value for money."
1335,The hotel is clean and quiet and the staff are professional. The buffet breakfast is not bad by Indian standards. The location is good you can walk to Karol Bagh main street and Metro station.
1336,"Singh Sons is tucked down as side street in a quiter part of Karol Bagh. The lobby is airy, cool and clean, with lots of marble, and the staff welcoming. No window views, but this is Delhi!"
1337,Hot water problems and electricity issues described by other travelers are typical for the country. Front desk staff is rude at best. Do NOT email the hotel for a room quote.
1338,"Basic city hotel. Stayed here three times with two rooms as Delhi was the returning point of our trip. Rooms are fairly clean and quiet but there's almost everytime a problem with the facilities. Non-flushing toilets, broken airco etc."
1339,Singh Sons is a mid-range hotel in the Karol Bagh suburb of New Delhi. No taxi or auto-rickshaw drivers were willing to take us to Connaught Place from here. The toilet had clearly not been cleaned and was really really disgusting.
1340,"We stayed here on our last night after a fantastic holiday. It was an appaling ending to a great trip. The room was clean, but that's the only positive thing to say."
1341,"Our Group stayed at The Hotel Singh Sons in Delhi. The rooms are small, claustrophobic and without windows. Two of the rooms smelled of smoke and two of the showers did not work. We arrived at 1am after a delayed flight and were asked to pay extra for breakfast."
1342,Hotel is not the safest nor the most interesting in Delhi. Hot water is just warm and must be requested 10 minutes prior to use. Packing your own toilet paper is key as the hotel provides very little.
1343,"The hotel was not 5* or even 4* in terms of presentation, amenities etc, but for being located in the peripheral of the city centre allows for good access to transport, eateries etc. For me, favoured most and by far exciting mode of transport are the local 'tuk tuks' which cost very little- but do remember to barter and agree a price for your journey BEFORE you set off."
1344,"We booked the hotel through an agent for one room for 3 persons. Though the room looked very nice, we have hard time getting other things. No provision for making coffee. For hot water, you have to call the reception and wait for half an hour. Not many hanger to hang your clothes."
1345,"Hotel is centrally located in busy streets of karol bagh, delhi. Most accessible to market just opposite the hotel. Good air conditioners when entered in such heat of india."
1346,"A decent place to stay in a very congested part of Delhi. One caveat - upon checking out, the guys behind the counter told me that the credit card machine isn't working."
1347,"For the price the hotel is nice, en suite bathroom with hot water and western flushing toilet, A/C and clean rooms. The location is fine, there is a local market nearby at night and it's relatively close to Connaught Place."
1348,"Stayed with my teen travel group for a couple nights. Showers were nice (hot and cold water), the staff were eager-to-please. AC was lovely and necessary :)"
1349,"We made an email booking for this hotel one month before our arrival in Delhi. They assured us the booking was ok and they had the availability of rooms. Of course, when we arrived at the hotel, no booking was made on the hotel books and no room was available."
1350,"Hotel is a rickshaw ride from the main centre (connaught place) So not a problem, nice restaurannt near by called alpha spice. The bathroom was big and there was a shower and western toilet but no bath."
1351,"Stayed there as part of an Intrepid &quot;comfort&quot;"" tour to Agra. It's conveniently located in the Channa market section of Karol Bagh."
1352," Singh Sons is a nice new hotel with a lot of nice marble everywhere (including all the lobbies and the stairs). The rooms are small and basic but very clean, as are the bathrooms which have Western style toilet seats. Also, the breakfast is quite nice - with pastries and eggs/omelettes in addition to tea/juices."
1353,The bathtub was coming out of one of the rooms such that I couldn't open the door. Avoid having a room near the lobby - it's very noisy. I loved India but Singh Sons was the low-light.
1354,"Booked directly with hotel on [-],good if you are shopping in Karol Bagh. Built 10 months ago...just be careful not to book any tours with tourist operators laundering around the hotel."
1355,We booked this hotel at the last minute as our initial plans on lodging got messed up and I was not able to access Trip Advisor to read the reviews about the hotels in New Delhi. The Hotel is located right near the Karol Bagh Market which is an added advantage for all bargainers in Shopping.
1356,"The rooms and the service were woefully bad. In the 3 nights we stayed my in-laws had to chang rooms thrice. Their travel desk, though manned by a couple of courteous staff, do have the odd disrespectable staff. The private delhi city tour we had was also not upto the mark."
1357,"While booking a room online the pictures showed a different image than what i was faced with when i was allotted a room in the hotel. The room was shabby, with cracked walls and missing soft finish patches and the Bathroom was also stinking, definitely not a room worth Rs 1800 +. Also the Travel desk said that the car i had asked for in the night, would be ready in the morning and when i called in the evening to double check, i got a blunt answer that there are no vehicles available."
1358,i saw the review of Hotel Southern from one of the review sites. our stay was comfortable. The rooms were good. and they also provided the complientary transfer from the airport. overall i appreciate the services of the hotel.
1359,I stayed in this hotel last week while on a business trip. The tour department and the restaurants are a must try in case you are planning a weekend trip to Agra.
1360,"A very nice place and perfect for tourist. Very close to airport, centre of city with lot of options for shopping, close to metro and sights. rooms and service is nice but only issue was that food was south indian so more preferred to them."
1361,This was the best hotel. Not only is this the opinion of only mine but I have brought a number of guests to this hotel (foreign and Indian nationals) and they have loved this place. Their hospitability and the cleanliness of this place is worth seeing and experiencing.
1362,"Location is very good, nearer to Karol Bagh Market, there is a biggest shopping mall in this area. New building, new furniture. Totally Its very good expirence in New delhi."
1363,A very comfortable stay with perfect staffs . one can go even alone and stay even if ur a lady. very much safety in all aspects . pakka friendly staffs from reception to bell boys.
1364,The Southern hotel in New Delhi is one of the most expensive hotels in the city. The hotel charges £40.00 a night for a double room. Not the place to stay for more one or two nights.
1365,"offering the ultimate hospitality, courtsey, great food, homely atmosphere, comfort, elegant furnishings. My stay was really worth !!"
1366,The hotel was centrally located and is ideal for tourists who proceed to pilgrimage circuits such as Char Dham etc. But please check out regarding the clause of free drop to Railway station as it is given in quotes and can put you in trouble if you depended on them.
1367,We booked the hotel through the website [-]. The pictures and the description is totally misleading. The hotel is spread over two buildings. We were given rooms in the adjoining building (which was a commercial building with shops on both sides) Only the top two floors of this building had hotel rooms.
1368,"I was less then happy when I turned up at about 1am to be taken to my rooms, I asked to see the rooms before I would take my cases to the rooms. When I saw the rooms which was a deluxe room I was not very happy bunny, so I went down and made it clear that if I am not given a better room at the same price then I would be going else where.I was then offerd two super deluxe rooms for the same rate as the deluxe but they wouldn't be available til the following night. After the first night service was much better and my family and i enjoyed our stay."
1369,"Make sure you get booking confirmation via email, as you may have problems at check-in. Have good travel agency next door so can book New Delhi tours."
1370,"You can find something better for a bit more - so do. Once you get to your room, they are OK, but getting there is through a scary neighborhood. Staff is not very helpful - particularly the middle aged guy at the front desk."
1371,The rooms were clean enough. Having to go out to the street from the Check-in area to the rooms is scary in the middle of the night. The hotel offers complimentary pick-up for their more expensive rooms.
1372,My husband and I had booked three nights at this hotel and left after one. Next to the check-in desk there was a doorway covered in a sheet- behind it several people were sleeping on the floor. Worst was the foot-wide hole in the wall of the bathroom that opened into an airshaft.
1373,"if you whant go to new delhi you must stay in hotel southern! this is very indian, verry nise and very clin hotel. there is verry reasonable price. in southern you are at home."
1374,"They were supposed to wait at airport and they didn't. After two hours I picked a local cab to hotel. Area, where hotel is, is quite grabby even according New Delhi standards. Rooms are simply disgusting."
1375,"Not a bad hotel, in a bit of an odd location in Karol Bagh, but only a 5-10 min walk to the metro station. Food was quite good (complimentary breakfast not so good) from room service, nice curries, though the sag paneer was the most radioactive looking one I have ever seen!"
1376,"Hotel in Karol Bargh is in a convenient central location. The hotel lobby looks impressive enough - especiallly considering the outside is a complete mess. I had booked the 'executive suite' - on first view the room looked ok. Once the door was shut, I had time to see how bad it was. The room was completely infested with cockroaches."
1377,Stayed in a super-deluxe AC room- which was brand new so that was good. They have dish TV in the room which is also good. The size of the room was small. Was initially showed a standard room and was disgusted.
1378,"Hotel Southern was our first trip to India and I imagine that among the other hotels in India, Hotel Southern is probably above average. I was not very impressed by the value of the Hotel Southern but it did provide a clean, okay location (most tourists stay near Conant Place) for a reasonable price."
1379,"The Hotel has a great service, very clean and very good locatation. With a travel agency in the hotel you don't need to move around."
1380,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights October. When I made my booking, the staff offered to pick me up from the airport and didn't show. When we did arrive, the room had cockroaches. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
1381,"Hotel southern, a luxury hotel in New Delhi provides the homely feelings, while you are away from your homes. We are today a preferred choice to stay among the travelers."
1382,"Hii am srinivasan from Tamil Nadu. We had reservation at hotel southern ,and informed them through email about our visit to New Delhi. They made every arrangements to pickup us from railway station."
1383,The property was very convenient and my stay was smooth. Room was clean and service was perfect. Thought i took the dinner &amp; it was great . Location was also decent one.
1384,This was my first visit to India. One of my friend suggested me to take a stay in this hotel. Hotel arranged complimentary airport pickup for me. The staff of the hotel was well trained and gave me a good service.
1385,The property was very convenient and my stay was smooth. Room was clean and service was perfect. I will definitely visit this hotel whenever I planned to come back here again.
1386,I enjoyed my stay at Sri Nanak in Delhi. Many thanks to owners Sandeep &amp; Karan who took personal care of us. Will definately stay at the hotel when I visit Delhi.
1387,A Perfect hotel for the business traveler and located in an ideal central area accessible from anywhere in the city any hour. Overall set up is excellent and counter staff courteous and helpful.
1388,"The hotel room was very good with modern outfit. Though room was spacious, its more than made up with modern amenities and good lighting. The restaurant was not very good."
1389,"The hotel was perfect for the price and just around the corner from bustling activity, shops, traffic and typical Delhi hustle and bustle. The only drawback is that the shower is not in a separate stall so water sprays over the floor of the bathroom."
1390,A Perfect hotel for the business traveler and located in an ideal central area accessible from anywhere in the city any hour. Overall set up is excellent and counter staff courteous and helpful.
1391,This hotel is situated in a market. Good area to stay in as it is a local indian area. Good shopping close by. Small hotel but friendly.
1392,"The hotel is cheap, located in an area with a lot of garages. We were upgraded for free - but the room we were upgraded to did not even have a window. Sheets and towels were partly dirty - so this was not a cosy place to stay."
1393,Room was fabulous with all the facilities. Staff were active with good smile on their face. Breakfast was excellent in taste. Hotel is centrally located in the main city.
1394,This hotel is centrally located in the main city. Our room was well organised with all the amenities. Also breakfast was tasty and it was served very well by the waiter of the restaurant.
1395,This hotel is centrally located in the main city. Rooms were well organised with all the amenities. Staff members were willing to help us anytime. breakfast was tasty and it was served very well.
1396,"Hotel is centrally located in the main city. Our room was wonderful, the room service managed the things well. The food quality too was up to the mark."
1397,"The hotel staff must rank as the most unfriendly and rude that I have encountered. They insisted i pay in cash or pay 2% more if I payed by card. If you wanted an extra tea bag , I had to fight for it."
1398,Average hotel in the busy Carol Bagh area. Not much to describe about except that you cant find another 3 star hotel in Delhi city for this value.
1399,"The most fantastic thing about this hotel is the hospitality. We ran into some emergency and I was amazed at the way we were helped out, especially by the management. It is right in the middle of Karol Bagh and accessible to the main shopping areas. We really enjoyed our stay here."
1400,Sri Nanak is definitely one of the best 3 star properties in Delhi. The hotel room &amp; the food was excellent. It was a perfect stay.
1401,The hotel is perfect for a stay in Delhi. We received a warm welcome from the hotel management. We were also given complimentary soft beverages and free laundry service.
1402,"Sri Nanak Continental is situated in a rather shabby neighbourhood in New Delhi. The A/C was old and very noisy, and it was not possible to leave it on when removing the room key to go out."
1403,"The hotel has a very dirty floor, somewhat smelly, and stains in the toilet. Hygene supplies like soap, shampoo, shaver, shower scrub and tooth brush/paste were all included. The restaurant has some great Indian dishes, but stay away from the continental breakfast."
1404,"Hotel Sri Nanak Continental has a weak organization. Air conditioner is very noisy, almost impossible to sleep. Room cleaning can be drastically improved. There are better hotels in Delhi at same price."
1405,My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night. My husband booked this place because it was shown as a top value hotel on Trip advisor! The location is not that great but that was not our main problem. The staff were very rude and extremely lazy. The bathroom was the worst. It smelt of cigarettes and I was not sure if they had actually cleaned the bathrooms before we arrived.
1406,"The hotel &amp; services were very much helpfull to me as I was the first time visitor to Delhi. They had a very good trip assistance, loyal drivers with cab took me to Haridwar+ Rishikesh+ Tajmahal."
1407,"The room was very small and unpleasent. Unable to sleep due to a loud noise from the street till 4 am. No hot water at bathroom. The breakfast was very poor, and the service poor as well."
1408,"The rooms were ok, but not very clean. My towels were dirty and phone didn't work, so I had to move rooms right away. I would not stay there again or recommend this hotel."
1409,"The service was very good, Bunty the taxi driver was great and very helpful. For a good quality cheap hotel i would stay here. The train station is near and in the middle of a vibrant area."
1410,Rooftop restaurant serves delicious chicken items. The travel desk &amp; staff were also very prompt. I booked this hotel via a travel agent and it turned out to be a decent choice.
1411,"The room was tiny with old style A.C. unit which allowed all the outside noise to come through, making it impossible to sleep. The shower had a very poor water flow, not enough have a decent wash. If you arrive early, like we did, they will charge you for an extra night."
1412,"Sri Nanak is a 4* hotel in Delhi, India. The rooms are newly renovated. The Wi-Fi is fast and the staff are prompt."
1413,"Hotel Sri Nanak was nice, clean &amp; comfortable as my daughter is very particular about the cleanliness of the bathroom. The hotel room was small but they have all facilities which we can never think in small luxury hotel. I will recommend other family travelers to stay in this hotel as the atmosphere of the hotel looks like home."
1414,Stayed for a night. The room was very noisy for 2 reasons:1. A/C was rumbling like it was about the explode. 2. There was some night-long celebration where there was chanting/singing in the street outside.
1415,"Our room was incredibly small, and a bit dingy. Staff was nice, though, and the breakfasts were good. The &quot;aloo parata&quot;"" was the best we had in India."
1416,"The staff were really helpful at all times. The food , rooms service all was very good. The Local Sightseeing with them was also a good one covering all parts ot delhi."
1417,We enjoyed this hotel very much . Its a nice family run hotel by Sandeep &amp; Karan. Very near to connaught places which is heart of Delhi. We stayed 3 night and really liked our stay at this hotel.
1418,"I stayed here three nights and had absolutely no problems, but the price of 2590 rupees is simply too high for this kind of accommodation. You can get a similar room at Cottage Yes Please for 900/night. The only real difference in service and quality was that Sri Nanak left a newspaper outside my door every morning."
1419,"We had very nice time at this hotel,Rooms, staff , internet , clealiness all was very good, we very much enjoyed our stay."
1420,"Sri Nanak Continental is a mid-range hotel in the Karol Bagh district of Delhi. The rooftop restaurant produced surprisingly good dishes, though the ordering process revealed some communication problems."
1421,"The staff were very polite and have good manners. The reception desk were very helpful in providing me with maps, information re shops and other matters. There does need to be some improvement in the management of the hotel domestic standards."
1422,The worst hotel we stayed in India. Staff were not friendly at all. Room was dirty and we had to keep close the bathroom door due to the smell.
1423,Service at the hotel was excellent. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Rooms were clean but the bathroom shower curtains could be better. The food at the restaurant was good and we had no complaints.
1424,"The hotel asks for INR 700 for a taxi to the airport, which is quite unreasonable. Air-conditioned radio taxi would cost at the most INR 450. Bathroom was of good standard to be a budget hotel in India, toiletries of acceptable quality."
1425,Maharaja suit could be a nice option for families travelling with young kids and tight budget. Location is not the ideal one … but not that bad either.
1426,"The Sri Nanak is a cozy place in a busy Delhi location. It's not within walking distance of much, but you'll feel like you're in real Delhi. There are small grocery shops, pharmacies and restaurants nearby."
1427,"Though I stayed at the hotel just for a night, I found the hotel very comfortable and peaceful. The staff was very co-operative and helpful. I would certainly recommend this hotel to my relatives and friends."
1428,"I stayed with Hotel Sri Nanak in March 08. The hotel was great, the services was just too great. The Owner sandeep was great too, he had a dinner with us and that was complimentary."
1429,"The hotel offered to pick me up from the airport, for 800 Rupees. I arranged a taxi at the airport for 250 Rupees, but took the driver a long time to find the hotel."
1430,I chose Sri Nanak hotel for 2 reasons: the location (it is nearby the place I needed to go to for business) and the reviews about the staff. The hotel is clean and provides a more than average service for the Indian standards of a 3 star. But a special note is for the restaurant: I had the most enjoyable indian food.
1431,This was our first trip to India and our first stay in this hotel. To me it bore no resemblance to the lavish reviews I've read on this site. I don't know quite how to rate this hotel as I haven't seen others in Delhi.
1432,"We spent 4 nights, in 2 stays, during March, in different rooms. The rooms are small, with little storage space, but clean, the bed firm but adequate. The air con worked but was noisy, the fridge didn't work."
1433,I was in India for one month doing volunteer work and stayed at the hotel the entire time. The family that owns the hotel was very helpful and even gave us a deal because we stayed for such a long time. They do what they can to make their guests happy and comfortable.
1434,My partner and I arrived early in the morning. We had given them details of our flight by email couple of days before. We stayed in their staff's room for a few hours until one of their guests checked out.
1435,"Picked this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews. The restaurant on top had very average food. The hotel rooms were very average. As for the location, I would not recommend any single women travellers to stay in this hotel."
1436,The Hotel Sri Nanak Continental is not in New Delhi but in Old Delhi. The hotel is in a dirty part of town but I believe it to be safe. Despite its basic appearance the restaurant is great.
1437,I booked this hotel through internet. It's a nice place to rest at the heart of busy shop houses. The food is fantastic and the staff is always smiling. What is important is I have free broadband internet.
1438,"The rooms were really dusty, I was constantly sneezing and wiping my nose. The bathroom was a disaster. Its a pity... this could be a really decent place if only they took the time to clean it."
1439,"Sri Nanak Hotel was a welcome respite from the busyness of Delhi. Staff were friendly, supportive and helped us acclimate from the USA."
1440,"The bed was not comfortable and though the linens looked clean. The bathroom was an average hotel in India bathroom (no bathtub, shower with a bucket and a sink and toilet). The location of the hotel was not good. There was constant noise from the street."
1441,"The hotel is located in the middle of the motorcycle repair district of a market. The room there was fine, even though the bathroom was dirty and there was no hot water. I very much recommend AGAINST booking a room at this hotel."
1442,"Hotel kindly arranged a pick up from the Airport, got in at approx 0130 am. The hotel is located in a very busy market place and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone wanting a gentle introduction to Delhi."
1443,"Hotel Sri Nanak Continental is a mid-range hotel in New Delhi. The restaurant is a little on the dismal side. The neighborhood is very congested and noisy, but the metro is at a convenient distance."
1444,"The Sri nanak Continental in Delhi is one of the most expensive hotels in India. Staff were helpful at all times, the restaurant is actually a cafe and the food was good."
1445,Hotel Sri Nanak is located in a rather sketchy area of Delhi. Hotel elevator is claustrophobic with screen gate- I preferred the stairs. Nice attention paid to decorating the hallway with a pleasant statue.
1446,"The hotel is decent, if you've been to Delhi you know how hard can it be to find a decent midrange hotel. The location is very chaotic and there is a is a large Sikh temple that starts chanting at about 5 am. The rooms are clean but old although some are updated, the breakfast is average compared with other hotels in India."
1447,"Hotel Sri Nanak is located in Karol Bagh, a busy market area of Delhi. The hotel offers suites (with 4 beds) suitable for a 6 person family. The room itself was spacious and of a basic 3-star level."
1448,"Hotel in Karol Bagh is a little out of the way, but worth keeping the hotel's card for directions for autorickshaw drivers. Free WiFi and internet access w/ computer. Average restaurant."
1449,"The rooms are well decorated, with a flat screen plasma on the wall. You get slippers to wear while in the room. The upstairs restaurant is excellent, with it's own chef. A fairly large selection of Indian cuisine."
1450,"This is a friendly, clean, modern well run place. It's within walking distance of the metro and the Ajmil Kahn Road bazzar. Free Wi-fi thoughout the hotel would have been useful if we had a laptop!"
1451,Sri Nanak is one of the best hotels in Delhi. The staff are very helpful and respectful. There is an excellent balcony on the roof with plants.
1452,Sri Nanak is a highly maintained hotel which is worth the price you pay for. The food served at the roof top restaurant was very delicious and of high quality. The free Wi-Fi service they provide is also good.
1453,We booked the most expensive room at the Sri Nanak and it had no windows and creaky air conditioning. On checkout they tried to charge for the expensive room. We got another room which was reasonably clean but had a slightly derelict toilet.
1454,"it is no less than any of the U.K. hotels,and that to at very comparitive prices. Have wireless facilties for free."
1455,"The Sri Nanak hotel is located in the heart of Delhi, India. The hotel is one of the most popular in the city. The free wireless in the rooms was much appreciated."
1456,The noise inside and out made it impossible to sleep - as did the hair from the previous guest left on the sheets. I would strongly advise against staying in this hotel.
1457,very isolated - long walk to train station. filthy street even by delhis standards. grim breakfast. redeeming feature - flashy showers - if they worked properly!
1458,Overpromised and greatly underdelivered. Hotel's website states 'running hot and cold water' - hot water was only available on running the hot tap for over 20 minutes. At 4am we were woken up by someone banging on our door.
1459,"It is not a bad hotel if you compare it to other Karol Bagh hotels, but unfortunatelly it costs 10 times what another similar kind of hotel will cost you."
1460,"The presidential suite is ideal for a family as we had two separate rooms within one room. Hotel location is fantastic with the Gurudwara, McDonalds and Pizza Hut, ATM and the great shops all in walking distance."
1461,Sri Nanak is a mid-range hotel in the Karol Bagh area of Delhi. The hotel has a presidential suite and a roof top restaurant. The food at the restaurant is generally tasty.
1462,Rooftop restaurant was extremely average. Location was on a very nosiy busy street in a very run down area of Delhi. Most guests are locals.
1463,"Nice enough place. Nothing great on the outside, but rooms were more western then most. I would reccomend it over many other hotels."
1464,"The Sri Nanak is a hotel in Agra, India. The rooms are reasonably clean, but the bathroom is below standard. The front desk tried to over charge us for taxis, cars and excursions."
1465,"The hotel was very noisy, the bed sheets reeked of some petroleum products, the phone did not work, the shower did not have a curtain and the flow projected straight over the toilet. The roof top breakfast area had filthy tablecloths."
1466,"The rooms are not in good condition, the duvets and blankets are not clean. The hotel had promised us a welcoming fruit basket which we did not receive. When we booked taxis from the hotel, we later discovered that the hotel was charging a commision for the service."
1467,The hotel did send a driver to pick us up from Delhi airport which was a god send. I am surprised that no-one seems to have mentioned how hard the beds were though. I asked for extra blankets to put under me as it was like sleeping on a rock! The hotel is also quite noisy - but so is India!
1468,"We stayed at this hotel after reading the reviews on tripadvisor and overall I would say it was good place to stay. The staff were polite and happy and the manager Sandeep was friendly and takes a lot pf pride in his hotel. We had a problem with the TV , they fixed it promptly."
1469,average 3 start hotel situated in a busy commerical area. not your above average hotel (this will cost you an arm and leg in Delhi) Staff and management go out of their way to make your stay stress free and relaxing as possible.
1470,"Karol Bagh is not the best area to stay in but the hotel staff were courteous. Our girls room had the most terrible smell in the room and on all the bed linen. Our room had no fridge, the jug didn't work and the shower water just fell all over the floor of the bathroom."
1471,"The presidential suite is ideal for a family as it can easily sleep up to 5 - 6 people. The hotel had some nice touches including free internet access, a daily paper pushed under the door and a fresh bowl of fruit served every day."
1472,"I stayed in this hotel in January. It was clean, inexpensive and the staff were generally helpful. However, this hotel is definitely not a luxury option and the location in Karol Bagh is not great."
1473,"The hotel was average, nothing special at all. Our particular room had no windows and the mattress was very thin! The staff at the front desk did really care about anything and were always on the phone."
1474,"The executive room was clean and quite modern, with a nice bathroom with shower. Try to avoid eating in the resturant, as it was nothing special. If you need a place just for the night i would recomend Sri Nanak continental."
1475,Hot water was by request and then you needed to wait 30 minutes. Breakfast is very basic and not very tasty. We didn't like the area either as you aren't near to anything really.
1476,"Sri Nanak is located in Karol Bagh, one of the busiest and most authentic street markets of Delhi. The hotel itself is simple, but clean, and the staff is quite friendly. A big plus should also be mentioned: they offer free WiFi in all rooms!"
1477,"For a first time visitor to delhi we found the surrounding location pretty scary. The hotel itself was clean and tidy, the staff helpful and the food was ok. would i stay again - yes i think i would."
1478,Being a lone female arriving in Delhi at 4am I was very pleased to take advantage of the free hotel transfer. The staff were excellant and went out of their way to help. The beds were reasonably comfortable but not sprung.
1479,"If you are looking at this hotel and are used to the good stuff (Sofitels, Hiltons, etc.) you SHOULD STOP NOW. The whole Delhi experience is a jarring one for westerners, and frankly, while going to a hotel like this is safe, it will make the experience that much more trying."
1480,"Think 1970's Best Western or Days Inn goes masala, and you'll get a sense of decor and premesis condition. The place is cleanish: some of the hardware is old, but nothing is dusty or moldy, just worn."
1481,"The hotel is very clean, not luxury level, but for the price, it's a bargain. The restaurant and staff are outstanding, and the free internet is a bonus. The only down side is that the neighborhood is nothing special."
1482,"Very large room, with 1.5 baths. Clean, and service was very good. Ordered room service and food was good as well. Free internet. Located near Connaught Place."
1483,"The hotel is located in Karol Bagh which is a very busy and tight area in the centre of Delhi. The rooms are fairly spacious and tastefully decorated, spread over 3 floors. Free internet access is also provided in the hotel's basement. Sightseeing tours are available in comfortable air conditioned vehicles."
1484,"I can only confirm all comments. Good choice for people used to stay in similar hotels. Honest experience. Luc, Paris.Luc, Paris"
1485,"Tidy and inexpensive hotel with good service, a/c, friendly staff and a rooftop restaurant with good dahl. The neighbourhood can be crazy during market days but metro is near."
1486,"I often go to Delhi like every month for my business and will stayed in many differant hotels in Delhi, but this time I booked hotel sunrise. Hotel people provide me best service and made me permanent customer. Because they fullfil all my requirements and very conveniat place for my office work."
1487,"Hotel Sunrise is just 100 m from Karol Bagh Metro, the most happening place of the town. The food here is fabulous, the staffs are very co-operative specially the front desk manager was Ms Leena."
1488,Very good service at hotel Sunrise. Helpfull and kind staff. Hotel location is very good market is very near and metro station is also near.
1489,Me and my husband book this hotel through a website hotels.com for 5 days. Hotel people pick-up us with kind of grand welcome with flower garland. We reccommend this hotel to all the italian who go to India.
1490,It was a horrifying experience sleeping in a room with no ventilation and no natural light. I could notbreathe properly. I wish that I could have stayed in a hotel with some ventilation. I found much better hotel in my onward journey.
1491,Staff were OK as long as you kept tipping them. Breakfast was terriable. There is no resturant but the do have room service agian the food was awful.
1492,Why do they have to use the detergent which give a foul smell in therooms. I change my room 5 times but the rooms were dark and smelly. Had to manage the night because it was 1’o’ clock at night and Ishifted to a nearly hotel which was much better.
1493,A bunch of touts who are only interested to make extra money. We werecharged heavily for going to Taj Mahal by taxi. We could have done thesame thing from another travel agent at one third of the price.
1494,The hotel and rooms there are faultless. The service there is exellant and you will not be dissapointed by the hospitality given by all the staff. The restaurant serve beautiful food and is very good value.
1495,"The hotel owner lied to us several times when we asked him travel questions. He told us that the only way to travel was by train or car, and that we would have to wait 8-10 days for a train ticket. He offered us a car too; as a ridiculous price, and tried showing us pictures of happy customers."
1496,"I stayed at Sunrise for 17 days last month - over the Diwali period. I am about to return there in December. It is a newly and completely restored small hotel, new bathrooms, furniture and a nice new mattress etc."
1497,"I paid for three days, I stayed there ZERO days and left with NO receipts or bills to prove anything or file case against them. They recognized me on the street, asking me &quot;what are you doing here? we didn't expect you&quot.;. Refering to our agreement and payment, they just said &Quot;In business, trust doesn't matter."
1498,We booked this hotel for 1 day to check there services and thought if they provide us good service then we can extend our stay. They pick-up us from airport early morning because our flight Finn Air was arrive at Delhi airport very early morning. They provide us very good room with window with Balcony. We recommend Hotel Sunrise.
1499,"Sunrise Hotel in Tokyo, Japan is one of the best hotels in Japan. Hotel Owner and other staff speak Japanese very very well. Room was specious with hot shower, which we Japanese people like very much."
1500,"The best aspect of this hotel is the remarkably low price -- around $30 per night. The neighborhood, however, is a drawback. The streets are terribly crowded, noisy, and dirty."
1501,"Hotel Sunrise is the best hotel in budget price. Me and my wife stayed in this hotel we feel very comfortable. Food was good, Hotel staff was kind and friendly."
1502,"Hotel owner did not seem to run a hotel business, he was rather intersted in booking my agra-jaipur trip. On complainin he promised to upgrade me only if i book trip with him. When i refused for the trip, a black tall man with red eyes took me to his travel agency."
1503,"Hotel Sunrise is the hotel clean and comfortable. It's create as a Home away from home. They don't provide you just a service, but they give you an experience. all staff are very Friendly."
1504,Its a worst ever Hotel I have stayed with. Staff with no professionalism. Taxi drivers are sitting at reception in dirty clothes looking for there customers. Rats &amp; lizards are just like room partners staying over there.
1505,I stayed in Hotel Sunrise for 4 nights in late September 2009. House keeping was excellent. Hotel mangement was very friendly and helpful. Almost every one in the hotel staff spoke English.
1506,"Hotel Sunrise is a good clean and safe hotel for family. Friendly and good staff and always ready to help. We have booked Delhi, Agra, Jaipur and Haridwar trip with this Hotel in a package."
1507,"The driver in Delhi was ok. But then when we traveled to Agra from Delhi, the driver was horrible. He yelled at us and made the trip horrible. If I had to do it over again, I would have found a different tour group."
1508,The room they gave us didn't have any windows and the bathroom was below standard. The receptionist charged us 5 times the normal taxi fare to the train station. Stay away from this place. They run it like an indian mafia.
1509,"Hotel Sunrise is a new hotel in Delhi, India. The rooms are well presented, extremely CLEAN and well fitted out with TV, bar fridge, AC and attached bathrooms."
1510,"I Mrs. Naidoo traveled with my Sister to New Delhi booked the hotel sunrise from South Africa. As per our booking, everything went as planned. we were picked up from the airport driven start to the hotel, on arrival it was the most unexpected welcoming."
1511,I came for business to Delhi. However I am a frequent traveller and saw a good review of this &quot;so called new hotel. But oh God it should not be termed as a hotel. It had RATS in the room. The bed sheets were torn. The Aircondition was not working and there was no water when I went to take a shower. The bathroom had so much of foul smell that I had to pack up my bag and just leave.
1512,"The Hotel is brand new and it shows. Rooms are small but neat and clean. Staff is very courteous and though the restaurant is not yet open, the Room service more than adequately makes up for it."
1513,"I booked 2 nights at this hotel through expedia, the price included pick up from the airport which was important to me as a single female traveller. i received an e-mail from the hotel before I left for India confirming pick up however upon arrival at the airport there was no-one waiting for me. I contacted the hotel by telephone and was told to get a pre-paid taxi and they would pay for it. I did this however taxi driver was unable to find the hotel. It was 2 o'clock in the morning by this time and the area was deserted. We eventually found a travel agent who amazingly was still open. He paid the taxi driver who just got my case out of the car and left me."
1514,"Hotel Sunrise opened four months ago and, as such, seems to be an undiscovered budget gem in the heart of bustling Karol Bagh. I give 4 stars to service only because some local staff are still learning subtle aspects of room service."
1515,hotel manager was very helpful and looked after me and my friend as it was diwali. They advised us not to go out alone as we were likely to hit by fire crackers. Food was good and prices were cheap in comparison to other places.
1516,"We found Delhi to be a very filthy, polluted and loud city and really would have enjoyed an oasis from the chaos but this was not it. like most of india this hotel was dirty the room looked like it needed a good cleaning. we had a large fan in our bathroom that was very loud with scary exposed wiring and the entire room had a moisture problem. the room service menu was crusted with food."
1517,"The hotel was a good area with lots of shops and was very close to the Metro. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was large, and there was plenty of hot water."
1518,"Hotel in Dehli, India. Rooms are clean, no windows. However mini bar, dont drink the water in there, not sealed, they just refilled from tap water. on breakfast, i saw some insects close to breakfast table, not hygenic at all. If you can find a other hotel, it is better."
1519,We recently returned from India after the marriage of our son in Amritsar. We had to stay one noght in Delhi to catch next days flight. Our agent had advised us that he had booked this hotel for one night for us.
1520,The rooms and clean and comfortable with snacks and a minibar. The bathrooms are pretty good with big corner baths and a powerful hot shower. The staff are friendly and helpful.
1521,The Sunstar Grand is one of the most luxurious hotels in India. The hotel is located on the banks of the Ganges River. It is located in the heart of the city and is located near the airport.
1522,"Hotel itself is good, rooms okay if a little small but hot water and a decent bathroom made up for it. restaurant was good and on the rooftop so was nice to sit up there away from all the hustle and bustle. Hotel accomodation overall was okay it was a shame the staff werent as helpful as they could've been."
1523,"The Sunstar Grand was in a quiet part of the city and generally was safe. The staff was a little sluggish and seemed very eager to earn some tips. Overall, the room was clean, but the bed linens were a bit worn."
1524,Restaurant staff were worthless. 4 or 5 staff could'nt get a table cleared for us at breakffast and the hotel was'nt full.Front desk staff were slightly pushy and appeared often whenever a tip seemed extractable.
1525,"Nice hotel close to the city. Fairy noisy at night time but noise level just enough to get some sleep. Room and bathroom were very clean, modern and spacious. Overall, a good hotel at a very reasonable price."
1526,"We stayed in this hotel twice whilst on a group tour of Northern India. It was a good size , located at the back and had a window and good sized bathroom. It had marble floors, cable TV, tea and coffee making facilities which was good."
1527,"Decor is kitsch, but new, modern and not unpleasant. Rooms are small and the bathrooms are very small. Demand a room with a window, otherwise you will probably be assigned my room (202) , which was windowless."
1528,"We stayed there twice. The first time we got a small room with NO window and a shower room. The second time the room was bigger, had a bathroom, and windows :-) In both cases the rooms were clean. Breakfast was included and in winter is served in an unattractive room in the basement."
1529,This hotel has lovely clean sheets and a lift and a fridge in the room. Watch out for the extra costs. The restaraunt was awful as was the food.
1530,"Sunstar Heritage is not my idea of a hotel. No sheets on the bed, 1 smoky smelly towel, opened bottles of water and no hot water."
1531,"The rooms are very comfortable, with great airconditioning and clean sheets and towels. The bathroom was clean and there was always hot water, which wasn't the case in many hotels I've stayed in India."
1532,Don't stay here--eerie place. Do NOT eat at the restaurant--awful food and filthy kitchen. Be aware that there was a bombing in the Karol Bagh market nearby.
1533,"- Not very professional- Unless good bargain is done, you will lose- No direct booking facility. Even if you try to contact hotel directly the hotel you'll end up in contacting a travel agent who works as a contact point on many nearby hotels."
1534,rooms were clean.not a great area of town (far from the center).rooms are clean and beds are ok.breakfast is a disgrace and service rivals that.
1535,"I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. The rooms were clean. The ac was not working properly. when I told the management, they sorted that out quickly."
1536,Stayed here as it was a better location than some of the others. I have to agree it was noisy but this was due to other guests and not traffic. We had a room at the back on the 4th floor 405. Price was 4452 rup around £53 for 2 nights.
1537,"The hotel seemed really ok at first glance, the room was clean, but ...The receptionist holds me back, saying &quot;my travel agent&quot;"" would be here in 2 minutes and wanted to see me about my stay in the hotel. Well, I had no travel agent, I booked the hotel through Internet. After a few minutes he felt my mood about his presence and excused himself. Back in my room I realise that the window is actually not a window but a window into a kind of ventilation shaft."
1538,I stayed at this hotel in March 2007. I was quoted a price for an executive suite as they said this was all they had available. It was downstairs. At first I thought it was ok as seemed clean but the noise was awful as it was on the ground floor.
1539,"I stayed here several times while having to transit through Delhi and found it to be pretty good with minimal problems. The food was great, the service was prompt and the rooms were good. The only downside is the neighborhood, Karol Bagh is quite chaotic and noisy....but then again all of Delhi is that way!!!!"
1540,"I am not sure that Sunstar Grand and Residency are the same hotel. They must be under the same ownership and close to each other, that's why it gets a bit confusing."
1541,"Also known as the &quot;Hotel Sunstar Grand. Marble floors and staircase. Nice older style with good furnishings and bed for this medium price range. Clean but worn linens, good service."
1542,"This place is a good surprise, especially if you have tried the terrible Ajanta hotel before!! Our room was large, clean, confortable, the bathroom huge with an amazing bathtub... The food was also excellent and service above average. I am going back there in few days and definitely recommend it !"
1543,"We stayed in Hotel Sunstar for 2 days in December and the experience was horrible. The room looked like a dungeom. Being in the busy Karol Bagh area, there is constant noice all night."
1544,"I was with a marriage party and we had booked our rooms in this hotel. We reached the hotel in the morning, after an exhaustive journey by train from Chennai. Service cannot be said Excellent, but considering its tariff, service provided is good."
1545,Hotel Swati is centrally located and moderately priced. Included vegetarian breakfast is good too. Wi-Fi internet access is included in the room rate.
1546,"We reached the hotel late at night after 10 hour drive from Fatehpur(Rajasthan) But, were stumped by the hospitality of the staff even at that odd hour. Check In was quick late night menu exhaustive and service commendable."
1547,It is good city hotel tucked in the shopping area of karol bagh. Restaurant is 100% vegetarian but good. The hotel is close to all basic necessities and the metro rail station.
1548,Good room/laundry service Execllent restuarant Excellent service through-out the stay. Booked the hotel online after reading tripadvisor reviews.
1549,Karol Bagh is a little nicer if you want a bit more of a calm location. Rooms as small but clean and have everything you need. Staff are helpful and no problems with anything there. Would recommend staying in Paharaganj though if travelling from New Delhi train station next day.
1550,"booked the hotel online via expedia after reading tripadvisor reviews, process was quite simple and painless. requested a king bed, but instead got two tiny twins. aircon was right over both of the beds like 2 feet next to one, which made it impossible to actually use while in either bed. room was right next to elevator and apparently the kitchen, as all i heard all night was the ruckus of the elevator and the kitchen staff washing dishes."
1551,"Hotel swati is in an amazing location in the heart of Delhi. The room rate we paid got us a room with beds and clean sheets. We hired a driver from the hotel to take us to the taj mahal. He picked up a guide who was pushy, and then proceeded to do a very subtle tourist trap routine."
1552,"For around $50 a night you get very good food, helpful service, and above adequate (clean) room facilities. The reason I started staying here is purely because I frequnted the hotel's Gujarati/Rajastani restaurant so often when I was in Delhi, it just made sense to stay in the hotel itself."
1553,"A/C, large bathroom &amp; shower, cable TV, refrigerator, and a sitting area in the room. Staff was very accomodating and arranged a cab for us to the airport at 0130 am."
1554,"Cable TV, free wi-fi, in-room safe (very rare for India), aircon, balcony (albeit onto a noisy side street), reliable hot water, complimentary bottled water (with the seals intact!), tea &amp; coffee making kit, nibbles, comfortable bed, complimentary morning newspaper, and free breakfast. Situated down a side street in the middle of Karol Bagh, a large bustling market and shopping precinct."
1555,"Hotel Swati is located in Karol Bagh, New Delhi. The meals are all thali style with no sharing. The staff can be indifferent if you have a special request."
1556,I stayed here at the beginning and end of an adventure travel type tour down the Ganges. First room I stayed in had blood on the sheets and when I removed the sheets couldsee the mattress was crawling with bed bugs. Went to have a shower but shower head blew off into the side of my face.
1557,"Hotel Swati is located in Karol Bagh, a busy area of Delhi. Staff are friendly and helpful but not overbearing like in some places."
1558,"Hotel is located in Karol Bagh, a few minutes from the airport. Restuarant has regional vegetarian thali's and a good buffet."
1559,"Staff begin work at 5am, opening and closing doors, talking, dragging chairs and tables etc. Nearby room had its bathroom just behind our heads - heard every opening of water, shower etc."
1560,"i had booked over the net into a another hotel that did not meet my expectations, so i walked around Karol Bagh and came across Swathi - immediately got my attention, clean lobby, profesional staff and very helpfull. I had a delightful stay and were very pleased with the hotel staff. Good manager, front desk staff... infact all the staff were polite, helpfull and well trained...Kuddos to them ..made my stay greattt."
1561,We stayed at the Swati Deluxe at both the start and end of an Intrepid tour. We found the location to be very good - close a metro station. The highlight for us was the vegetarian food court next door.
1562,The Swati Deluxe Hotel is located in the middle of Karol Bagh. The complimentary breakfast and the attendants serving it are very professional. Car parking is and bus parking facility is also their.
1563,"I liked the location. Close to the Metro Station, Restaurants. But the hotel can get its act together for Cleanliness and Service."
1564,"I had a good stay here. Of course, I got upgraded to a suite and hence could not experience the regular rooms. My bill also came about 9,000 lesser than my last stay in Delhi. I will stay in this place for my future travel as long as they extend the same facilities – discounts etc."
1565,This hotel is located near to a metro and there are alot of similar hotel with same pricing nearby. Please bear in mind that the hotel will charges 22.5% of taxes for the price shown on the pamphlet.
1566,"There are a multitude of mid-range hotels in Delhi and the Swati Deluxe is a good choice. The rooms are clean and they provided towels each day. The attached restaurant has very good selections for breakfast, lunch and dinner."
1567,"Our first night in India, the hotel gave us a fruit basket which consisted of an apple and a banana. We left it on our TV stand and during the night I could hear gnawing sounds! I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me, but in the morning we saw that the apple was half eaten!"
1568,"The hotel was well located, near restaurants and shopping. The room was quite dirty, with hairs all in the rumpled sheets and trash still in the trash can. Also we felt like the staff were not very helpful when we raised our concerns that the room not being clean."
1569,The rooms are clean and comfortable with decent hot water. Room service and a telephone is available in all rooms. The hotel is a hub for Intrepid tours and so is a good place to meet like-minded travellers.
1570,"Swati Deluxe is a very well located hotel, in the market center of Karol Bagh. It's not very expensive, and the rooms are okay, clean at least, with western facilities. You can make arrangements for transportation with the hotel directly, but there is a subway station close."
1571,"Very good service, big clean rooms, food ok, free breakfast. The only downside is the price but Delhi is expensive anyway. The hotel is located on the banks of the Yamuna River."
1572,"The hotel is located down a dark and dirty alley off the cycle market in Old Delhi. There is a full-time security guard at the door, though we didn't feel unsafe. The hotel does not serve alcohol, but they will send someone out to get beers for you. The food was decent and reasonably priced."
1573,"This place is like only for backpakers, not for family with young teenage children. The people in the street near hotel pass bad comment on women and girls."
1574,"Hotel is situated in the old Delhi, meaning if you like to be in a quiet neighborhoud, forget about it. However the hotel is in a small street and rooms are quiet."
1575,"I visit Delhi every year to help with a small charity called 'Butterflieschildrights' and have stayed in several hotels. This is by far the very best place I have ever stayed in. It is clean, friendly and the food is really good. I am a female of 65 years and feel really safe."
1576,"It’s a new hotel but not was built &amp; maintained. Furniture is good, rooms are small sized, bathroom tiles are dirty. Ok hotel but needs thorough cleaning and funigation."
1577,Had booked this hotel on the internet. We were a bit doubtful when we arrived in the dark. But once inside we found a very helpfu staff and travel bureau.
1578,This hotel is a real find. And in the middle of the noise and madness of old Delhi. Some fine restaurants in the area were recommended. The attached travel agency was oneof the best I have found in a long time.
1579,Has a free pick up from the airport/kamikaze driver from the paradise of India (Kashmir) A must for anyone wanting to expereince the real India at first hand.
1580,"Spent one day with my family here on arrival to India. They had a driver waiting at the airport. Very efficient, personable service, great rooms. Tremendous views of the old city from the rooftop."
1581,A fab place to stay in Delhi - dont miss it the best bit is the wonderful welcoming staff. The roof top is a must and if you like a beer the staff will bring you a table and chair to sit and admire the view.
1582,Stayed for 2 nights with my girl friend and surrounding place is very crowded and noisy. Lot of poor people baggers in the area and irritate you to heights.
1583,"The path leading up to Hotel Tara Palace looked shady, but since it was late at night I thought its better to have a room to stay in as opposed to looking for one in the dead of night. Another smart decision was consulting the in-house travel agent – Rameez who tailor made a tour for me."
1584,"The rooms are basic, but adequate but ours lacked a window which meant it was very quiet but certainly not a room you would want to spend alot of time in. The food is good homemade cooking (the sort your mum would make if you have a Punjabi mum!)"
1585,"It was my first time in india and i decided to go Old Delhi myself and i chose this Hotel Tara Palce and i don't regret my decision as i was a single girl they gave me a family atmosphere and i felt so comfortable and safe. Staff great, Special RAMEEZ helped me with some other travel isues...Deffinatly will be back again."
1586,"We booked a trip with Rameez and he was very helpful but i would suggest to anyone to make sure you confirm everythinhg with him and ask lots of questions. They tend to make lots of excuses and pass the buck, so confirm confirm confirm!!!!! The hotel that was booked in Varinassi was too far away from the Ghats, because you were out of the town you were at the mercy of the travel agent who works for this company."
1587,"The Tara Palace is a great little hotel! The staff is friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and large. Breakfast is included and I recommend the Indian breakfast of parrathas. The location is in the middle of Old Delhi, not on the normal tourist trail."
1588,Location down a little side street may seem quite intmidating but I found this was not the case at no time did I feel at risk. What is special is that not only can you see Red Fort and other sites from roof but the atmosphere of the area.
1589,"Nice and cheap hotel. The rooms are clean and you're just in the middle of old town, not so far from metro line. We stayed there 3 nights, avoid the room near the kitchen because they're always at work."
1590,"The hotel is clean, the staff efficient and helpful. The location of the hotel could appear at the first glance not very safe. But we felt safer wondering on foot there than in Paharganj."
1591,"Very clean rooms, confortable after a crazy day on the streets of old Delhi, very quiet, nice and allways available staff. Great food, we could say it was one of the best food we ate in India. Great value for price."
1592,"Hotel is located in the middle of old Delhi, in walking distance to the Red fort, the big mosque, and the NDLS and DLI railway stations. The restaurant has excellent food, maybe the best food we ate in India, available 24h a day!"
1593,"Front desk staff were outstanding, they were friendly, helpful and nothing was too much trouble. All our special requests had been arranged prior to arrival. The rooms were very clean and well appointed and security was very high on their list of priorities."
1594,This hotel was our first stop in India on a month backpacking trip. It was nice to have the pick up from the airport and the security of knowing someone was waiting for us when our flight arrived at night. Everyone in the hotel was helpful and we could literally order great food at any hour of the day.
1595,"Hotel Tara Palace is the cheapest hotel in it's class that I could find. Very neat and tidy rooms with good airconditioning. Free airport pick-up. Complimentary breakfast (Not great, but acceptable) Room service menu at very cheap prices. 15 minutes complimentary internet usage downstairs. Elevator to all floors."
1596,"Hotel Tara Palace had high marks from most readers on this score *and* it was reasonably priced. The con that most of these readers had to say was that it was hard to find as it was down a narrow alley way in the old part of town. We found the room to be spacious, the bedsheets and towels and the bathroom to be clean and bright."
1597,"I managed to find Tara Palace after a lot of wrong turns! But it was totally worth it! The alley leading up to the hotel is totally sketchy, but once you walk it a few times its fine! My room was pretty basic, and the overall service was decent. I am satisfied and will be coming back to Tara Palace!"
1598,"I warmly recommend the place to people who want to be in Old Delhi with security and comfort. You feel at home, all the staff is very friendly and the manager keeps to his word. We were supposed to stay 3 days and felt so much at ease that we remained till the end of our stay in Delhi."
1599,Hotel Tara Palace is a peaceful oasis of friendly faces. Rameez Badyari is a polite and knowledgeable young man who manned their travel desk. I heartily recommend staying at Tara Palace.
1600,"Tara Palace is located in an alleyway near the Jama Masjid mosque and the Red Fort. The hotel was reasonably priced and clean, the staff were helpful and the food was good."
1601,"I stayed here twice, the first time was planned and the second was because I wanted to see more of Old Delhi. The food was as good as any I tasted on my trip and the waiters were great guys. The front of house team were also first class - you can trust their travel desk."
1602,"Hotel was out of the way, in Old Delhi. continental breakfast was adequate, but the resteraunt serves vegetarian only. Don't expect much nightlife around. But it is good as a base to see the cities landmarks."
1603,"First time to Delhi, so many surprises upon arrival. Clean, quiet, good breakfast (included), nice shower, great rooftop view."
1604,Tara Palace is situated in the &quot;old cycle market. The hotel must mitigate an insect problem with moth balls as the bathroom's sink and floor drain had a couple a piece. The rooms had functioning air conditioners and ceiling fans which only work with the key inserted in the wall.
1605,"We stayed at the Hotel Tara Palace on the first night of our 3 week holiday touring India. Old Delhi was a real shock to the senses for me... perhaps I was a little naive. The staff were helpful and courtious, and our room was large."
1606,"probably as good as you will find in the chaotic centre of old delhi. All the facilities are clean,the rooms bright with adequate facilities the restaurant is fine the staff helpful. the price is a bargain for this standard of accom all in all a no brainer."
1607,Location is great for the Red Fort and in the midst of Old Delhi. Take advantage of the complimentary airport pickup - it's good to have a driver who knows how to find the hotel.
1608,Location is tough in general (old Delhi) but the hotel certainly stands out as an oasis. Pretty close to the subway and Red Fort... might want try to avoid walking around in the early morning though.
1609,"The hotel was pretty average and the walls were pretty thin. The alleyway was a little scary coming in late at night, but was much less so in the day light. The breakfast that was included wasn't bad, either!"
1610,They have the tv blasting 24 hours a day downstairs at reception and you can hear it in the rooms. The other annoying thing is the lift buzzer. They did arrange an airport pickup which was good.
1611,"Hotel Tara Palace was a decent cheap hotel, right in the heart of old Delhi and very close to the Red Fort and Jama Masjid. Staff at the desk were friendly enough but very pushy and reminded us of used car salesmen."
1612,"I stayed here for a week in October, 2008. Pre-paid airport pickup was prompt and as promised. The hotel room was very clean. The included breakfasts were solid. The desk staff was excellent."
1613,"For our first night in Delhi we chose this hotel after reading reviews and comparing different sites. We were so happy that we chose it again later on our journey, I do recomment to stay here- it is a pity that is not recommended on the guides."
1614,"The staff at the hotel were very nice and willing to help us plan our trip and get us taxi's. The room was clean and quiet and the room service was decent. As far as location goes, it is walking distance to the red fort and transportation is easy in Delhi."
1615,Hotel was clean. Rooms were made every day and soap/shampoo was replaced most days. Near the Red Fort and Chawni Chowk metro.
1616,"Clean hotel, good service depending with who you're talking, but in a sketchy location. Not too safe during the night if you wanna go out."
1617,"Great Location - 5 minute walk to Red Fort, subway station, McDonalds, and ATMsVery helpful front deskQuiet insideNice construction for the price (white marble floors, etc.)Good free breakfast included (proper breakfast, not muffins and juice boxes)"
1618,The hotel is clean and comfortable and the staff are lovely. It's located in a small alley in the back of Old Delhi which may be a bit overwhelmng for a first-time visitor. Note that their booking confirmation forms have no address or phone number on them so write them down separately!
1619,"Hotel is new with spotlessly clean, spacious rooms and comfortable beds. Staff were exceptionally friendly, they bent over backwards to assist. Internet is available in rooms if you have a PC and the room and laundry service was good."
1620,"I arrived at by myself at night., and as a female was a little apprehensive. I was given excellent, friendly warm service. The rooms were clean and neat. The restaurant served tasty food and nothing was too much trouble. The rooftop terrace provide excellent views over the Red Fort."
1621,Tara Palace was our first hotel in India and it was with some trepidation that we got off our coach in Old Delhi. The facade was not impressive - far from it; but the warmth began as soon as we walked in the door.
1622,"The hotel is right across from the Red Fort and very close to some of the other sights, but don't expect to be able to wander around past sundown. The key thing for us was that it was clean. If your taxi driver insists on calling ahead to confirm your reservations, it is a scam."
1623,"Hotel was clean, with an impressive lobby,although the room was smallish, but had all the facilities there. Red Fort, Raj Ghat, Gurudwara Sheesh Ganj and many other places of Old Delhi are at walking distance form the hotel."
1624,"This hotel was clean, however the experience of this hotel due to its location and the hotel staff was awful. This area of old delhi is massively crowded with men who stared with contemptuous disdain or who agressively hassled us for custom/tours you name it. If this is your first night in India after a long flight I'd recommend you stay in Connaught place or central Delhi."
1625,I stayed there in Jan'08 for a about 3 days after my marriage and before my Honeymoon in Goa. Room was clean and room service prompt. The size of room was quite good and bathroom was very clean and spacious too.
1626,"over priced - US$144 twin room with an extra bed. decent food ,both western and local. wifi is okay ,costly INR 200 per hour."
1627,"Hotel Vikram offers all the facilites you want. They are though a ona littl eexpensive side. Teh locations doe not have any major scenic locale, no views etc."
1628,"I had stayed there for one night and had some good sleep. It costs me around USD100, include breakfast, so quite good value. Very clean but it has no air con in the washroom and it is very hot this time round."
1629,"The Vikram Hotel is in 10 min drive to the Lotus Temple. Hotel personnel was polite and friendly, rooms were surprisingly clean. Restaurant food and service. Kingfisher beer is the best!"
1630,A decent and reasonably priced hotel in Delhi. Value for the money and the hotel is kept clean and maintained well. The staff are very cooperative and helpful.
1631,"Hotel Vikram was recommended by the travel agent and visited it before confirming the booking. The rooms are very clean, freshly done up and comfortable. Choose a carpeted room especially in winters as the rates are the same."
1632,"My friend told me about this hotel, it is value for money in everyway.Quality of food is also vey good infact I had the best Indian food here.Staff is very helpful and best part is location its right next to all the bars, shopping and also work places."
1633,"The staff was quick with check-in, but the floor lobbies &amp; rooms had old carpet, which smelled stale and bad. The restaurant was decorated well which made it pleasing to the eye. The food on the a la carte menu was one of the hotel’s stronger points. Wouldn't recommend or stay here again."
1634,"The hotel has an Indian doorman, complete with giant moustache and turban. Metal detectors were installed at the entrance, but don't work. The room was adequate though the immovable shower head was annoyingly weak."
1635,"The hotel is located near the hospital I was intending to visit, near Nehru Place. The hotel has a small restaurant, there are taxis available, and the hotel itself is no beter or worse than your average US economy hotel. I would stay this is a fine hotel for a budget tourist trip, but I wouldn't stay here on business."
1636,"Hotel Vikram is a 2-star hotel in Delhi, India. The rooms do not have ironing boards or an iron, so you have to dial room service to get one every morning. Every room has wireless Internet, but the connection is quite slow. The hotel has a Tourist desk that can arrange tours to Taj Mahal."
1637,"My family stayed at the Vikram at the end of October 2007 for 10 days. We negotiated Rs 10,000 per night for a luxury room including 2 extra beds and breakfast. In all honesty we have to say it equalled the 5* hotel we previously stayed in if you are a tourist."
1638,Hotel has its own common gardens and the market is mightily impressive. The snacks in the bar are terrific (try the chili chicken) and it's a great place for a quiet beer.
1639,"Front-desk staff was very unfriendly and very unhelpful. Location is not ideal, about a 30min drive by tuk-tuk to Connaught Place."
1640,"Hotel is situated in Lajpat Nagar, just off the Ring Road which is the main arterial road of Delhi. The lobby is bit on the smaller side but adequate seating is available for it's size."
1641,"Hotel Vikram in Lajpat Nagar is close to the Lotus Temple and other sites. It's clean, nice, and friendly, and not too far from the airport (always depending on traffic)"
1642,Hot water was temperamental and twice I had to take a cold shower. Hotel bar was small and pokey but the drinks and snacks were well priced. Check in was efficient but not very friendly.
1643,"Room was clean and comfortable enough, but bathroom window had no screen and was covered by some sort of tarp from the outside. Neighborhood is not nice, not a place to be walking around. Service was adequate."
1644,"Although rated as 4-star in India, this was definitely not a 4- star hotel. Plenty of hot running water (which leaked through the standup shower door onto the entire bathroom floor), but bed mattresses were old &amp; lumpy. Wouldn't recommend or stay here again."
1645,"Hotel Vikram is one of the best hotels in the city. Rooms are spotless and comfortable, shower and bathroom extraordinarily clean. Service was impeccable, from the front desk to the travel desk and hotel drivers."
1646,Hotel WELCOME PALACE is a PATHETIC HOTEL..mR miglani owner of this hotel is a cheat..All commitments are false.
1647,"When we arrived, weary from our flight and ordeal with customs around 3 am. We knew to expect to bargue for everything, but nothing would prepare us for this place. We ended up just splurging and staying at the Intercontinental! Much more expensive, but after this ordeal, the cleanliness and courtesy were worth the high price."
1648,Was there in late evening. Our Id was asked at the hotel and then transfered to room after check in. Next day on asking hotel for sightseeing hotel arranged it for 3 days. Delhi Sight Seeing/ Agra same day tour &amp; shimla 2 days.
1649,"The first room we were in was very dirty, had holes in the wall, and no windows! After inspecting the room further we found rat droppings on the nightstand and on the floor. The management also changed our rates upon checking out."
1650,"I join the opinion of the others - it was a horrible experience. Staff was sooo rude! They also had organised airport transportation for us even though we didn't even talk abt that with them. The rooms were horrible soo dirty and disgusting, + only cold water etc."
1651,"We stayed in this hotel for most of the time and had the worst experience there! When we first checked in, we asked for the exact pricing of the rooms and cabs etc... so that we don't get conned later on. The rooms are very badly maintained with no hot showers and badly done electrical installation."
1652,"Don't be fooled by the name of the Hotel... You would neither be welcomed properly... nor it is a Palace whatsoever... In fact, it's the total opposite... The rooms are among the worsts I've ever seen... The electric wiring seems so dangerous, just mere connections between wires... Beware, you could be electrified! The hot showers were never hot... even if you asked them to put the roof boiler on... I wonder if the bedsheets, glasses, bathroom are ever really cleaned..."
1653,"The rooms were ok for 2 persons. However, having a hot shower is a problem. It was pure luck to sometimes have hot water and sometimes not."
1654,"We stayed in Hotel Welcome palace on the 25th-26th October 2007 and then, from 29th October till 1st November 2007. We asked the owner to give us a wake up call at 430 on the 26th and arrange for a cab @500. On the 29th, there was no cab waiting for us at the train station. We take a cab on our own, since none of the requests we had made earlier were not satisfied. Do NOT go by the manager's words, as he will findsome good excuse to charge you more."
1655,"Hotel Welcome Palace is located near Karol Bagh shopping area. Considerable traffic outside, so it can get noisy in the room. Bathroom is not well maintained, some fixtures are missing."
1656,"The Welcome palace hotel in Delhi is one of the most expensive hotels in the city. We stayed in a shoe box room, with no AC, no towels, and no loo roll. We were then expected to tip 3 bell boys who all jamp at the chance to grab our 2 rucksacks, to take up 1 flight of stairs to the room. This then continued for the rest of the stay, we would arrive back after a hot sweaty day of sightseeing, our room would not have been serviced, and after jumping in the shower, up to 4 knocks at the door till 9.30pm with porters bring various things. We have now moved to another hotel."
1657,"I stayed at Welcome Palace for three nights in May with my Wife and eighteen year old daughter. Staff was very friendlier,polite &amp; attentive. Food was of our high standard, service without fault. The rooms are extremely comfortable, with great views."
1658,"The hotel is basic and as a one time Peace Corps volunteer, I found it met all my needs. The main drawback was the location which was not familiar to many rickshaw or taxi drivers. The area was chaotic and noisy but the room was fairly quiet."
1659,We stayed here for 2 nights in April 2007. Generally the reception area was OK and the staff reasonably helpful. The sheets on the bed had already been slept in and there were some fairly unsavoury bugs in the bathroom. Breakfast was OK but took ages to come and you have to eat it in the lobby (which is where I saw the rat).
1660,"stayed at this amazing place called welcome palace.. where everything is easy to get food, travel nice executive suite,any help any time. this is in heart of city, good shoppin place around mc donalds, sravan bahvan all good food joints and food of welcome palace rocks.. .. was there for vacations after very long and i think had wonderful time... vacations was fun like never before. All the best to welcome palace and their vry vry helpful employees . keep it up...Mili"
1661,"The Welcome Palace Hotel is a five star hotel in Mumbai, India. The hotel is divided into two different segments. The rooms are spacious and the staff are friendly and helpful."
1662,if u wanna live in delhi close to the airport and closer to gurgaon then it is a good place to stay.comfortable rooms.
1663,"Customer service is bad and they have no proper manner, not up to the standard not a 4 star hotel. bathroom is really bad, very very small and dirty. food was bad. people in the hotel were bad and not friendly."
1664,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights waiting for transfer to Cochin and by our travelagents mistake 2 nights more on the way back to Sweden. The hotel are built like a echo chamber, every little noise from the rooms or the reception (phones, staff make dishes/cleaning middle of the nigth) go straight into your room. There was bad smell in our rooms, no windows and very dark inside."
1665,"The Westend Inn is a very basic hotel. It's generally clean, but make sure you get a renovated room on the side across from the pool. The wifi is a joke-it didn't work for the majority of the time we there. The food is pretty decent here and cheap."
1666,Very bad experience. Stay away. Hotel employees kept asking for tips and wouldn't leave the room until i've paid them. I called the hotel desk to arrange a taxi to the airport because i thought a hotel arranged taxi would be more trustworthy.
1667,Hotel is well maintained and staff are very courteous and helpful. The only downside is the location which is isolated from other facilities and involves an adventure in Delhi traffic.
1668,"Stayed here for one night en route back to the UK. Room was spacious, and the marble floor gave a sense of luxury. The bathroom was very poor, the walls had patches of mildew and the fittings were covered in limescale. The worst problem was the noise."
1669,The shower was made of three glass walls that joined with about an inch gap between them. Food at the restaurant was abysmal. I'm pretty sure there were fleas in the bed.
1670,"We stayed here because a travel agent booked us in saying it is a 4 star. Check in was pathetic, they always give a bad room first. They will change to better room after you complain."
1671,The hotel is not up to strong standards if you are looking for a four or five star hotel. The English language is a challenge for some of the staff. The property itself is not bad and has potential.
1672,I was transiting via Delhi and had to spend the night. The airport counter recommended this hotel and gave me a ride to the place. Noticed a party going on in one of the rooms with loud music and over 50 guests and called the front desk if they knew about a party and when it would end. The party went on till well over 2:00 AM.
1673,"very run down, dirty and mosquito ridden - don't believe the non-smoking policy. Front half of the attached building is collapsing, half demolished, looks like an earthquake zone. Buffet was disorganized but OK."
1674,"Hotel is next to a major highway, means constant traffic noise, and full 'perception' of hotel noises as well. Staff is at best strange, usually fully dismal. Receptionist not really speaking English."
1675,"There were mosquitos in the lobby and the entire place looked like it was falling apart. The towels were gray, there was no shower curtain, and I felt it necessary to shower in flip-flops."
1676,"The White House is a five-star hotel on the banks of the River Ganges in Northern India. The hotel is located in the heart of the city, but is also close to the city centre."
1677,"I would rate this hotel as average-good in terms of cleanliness &amp; food.Location is ok, and was good for access to Karol Bagh/Connaught Place during the day. As a lone travelling female did not feel overly safe in the evening."
1678,Website said they had Hotel pickup. I had to call to confirm and then they tried to charge me for it. Trip to national airport was double the usual cost. Rooms had peeling walls and some mold.
1679,Rooftop restaurant was quite enjoyable although slightly restricted menu-wise. The food was fresh though and the service friendly. Superb throughout.
1680,Stayed here for a week although went on a tour for 3 days. Had to haggle a price with a taxi to get me to the hotel at 2.00 in the morning. Don't change money in the hotel.
1681,"Hotel was booked for us through a tour group we used to organise a tour of India. Location-wise, it is not bad. Not far from the shopping district of Karol Bagh."
1682,I checked in this hotel with my daughter and wife on 30th April night for 3-days. The 1st thing which was very shoking to us was the condition of the bed. The bed sheets and pillow covers were full of stain and were of lowest quality. Breakfast is not at all worth for money. Staffs are not friendly.
1683,"We booked directly with the hotel in September 2006 for a one night stay in October. As we were staying four nights, we were offered two free pick ups from the airport. We provided our credit card details as security. When we arrived at the hotel we were asked to pay for the pickup. We asked for two club rooms and were given standard rooms and charged club prices."
1684,"Delhi can be very smelly, and quite dirty, the Hyatt is a welcome respite from it. There is a pool but I've never gone out to it, the air is to vile!"
1685,"The hotel has several restaurants (international, chinese, east Asian, Indian) as well as a beautiful bar with live music in the evenings. All the staff in every department of the hotel was extremely helpful and polite, always with a smile."
1686,"We stayed two nights here and I would first commend the service at this hotel. The staff were alert, attentive and courteous at all hours day and night. I dined at the Cafe and the Italian restaurant, and the quality of food was very good at both - the cafe in particular had a wonderful selection of breakfast items."
1687,"The hotel is what I would call a business class hotel, it offers a high level of service, but at a price! The room was nothing special, it did smell a bit musty, large television and decent channels. Overall we liked the hotel, but compared to others on the trip it was extremely expensive."
1688,"Great place to stay. Lobby is huge, three restaurants, a bar, a mini-golf course in the back, nice pool, very safe, rooms were huge and very comfortable."
1689,"I stayed in the executive floor for over two weeks, and can say that I had a great stay. My biggest complaint would have to be the internet. It was painfully slow, and the connection would drop far too much."
1690,"The Hyatt's website allows you to book all kinds of things through it, ranging from airport transportation, spa treatments to a restaurant table. I can really recommend the China Kitchen, it's an experience with friendly staff and in a lovely setting."
1691,Beautiful lux rooms to wash away the hectic Delhi circus. The buffet breakfast is one of the best I have had. Stay there.
1692,"The check-in process was not good. The carpets in the corridors and the furniture in the rooms were completely outworn. In one of the rooms, water was flowing from the walls."
1693,I have booked through Jet airways website under the Hotel booking section as it was offering competitive rather cheap rates in the club floor. The club lounge is basic and simple and attendants are always attentive and overly curious.
1694,"Probably the worst stay ever in any hotel in India, I arrived after a long flight from London in the afternoon and after the massage went stright to a meeting. When returned in the evening called the Reception to advice the Air conditioning is not working. The whole night the temp didnt go below 25degrees centrigrade. Housekeeping kept knocking the door at 9am asking it to be cleaned."
1695,"The services of Hotel is supreme, one of the best in Delhi for sure. Interiors, exteriors, all are royal with luxurious comfort."
1696,"My two daughters and I stayed on night at the Hyatt. The staff was very helpful, proffesional and courteous. Ambience and decor was perfect."
1697,A great atmosphare for business review with pure mental satisfaction at the end of the day.Foods &amp; Room were excellent.
1698,After a wonderful stay at the Le Meridien in Mumbai - I was expecting the same or more at the Hyatt in Delhi. The actual room itself was spacious and newly decorated....however after checking in - I noticed an ash tray...which explained the smell - as I'm a non smoker - I asked to change rooms - as the smell would not just disappear!!
1699,We Visited there for Dinner &amp; Stayed in one room for one Room also.......It was Excellent stay for our Friends. Management is too Co-operative. Cleanliness in Hotel is No. 1....
1700,The hotel is a perfect location if you have business meetings in the centre of New Delhi. The restaurants in the hotel are excellent and specially the Italian restaurant is outstanding.
1701,"best hotel i have ever been to, nice staff and nice service, everything was perfect. quality of food was also very good, such a delicious food i haven't eaten in my whole life. i liked the service most."
1702,Huge facade is one of the most recognizable structures of Delhi. Palatial lobby and extremely efficeint service. Standard Rooms though feel a bit cramped for space.
1703,Very well located business hotel. central and not far from the business districts and the airport. good service. the italian restaurant was exceptional.
1704,I had booked a standard room for a day when I travelled to Delhi for a meeting. Room was very clean and upto 5 star stds.Quite a selection of cuisines to offer both through room service as well as restaurants.
1705,The hotel is in the real sense a complete hotel. It has everything that a buisness traveller needs. Comfort level was too good and the staff were friendly enough to give you an unforgetable experience.
1706,I stayed here for a day for a business trip. As i expected rooms were luxurious with beautiful pool view. hotel provides excellent food. Hotel staff was very courteous and friendly.
1707,"Went to stay for 1 night for my Business purpose. There was NO Bathtub in the room!!!!!! On top of that, there was no cover for the Shower area, which left the whole bathroom wet."
1708,"When compared to the other Hyatt Regency in India, this ranks the worst. The room is smaller than the otherRegencies . This is my second stay in 8 days. My club room has a toilet that flushes badly."
1709,We took our children to India so that they know their heritage. Booked three rooms at Hyatt and from the time we arrived in lobby we were treated well beyond expectation. Rooms though smaller but beautiful and luxurious.
1710,"excellent five star hotel with notable ambience. overpriced, food good but highly overpriced. breakfast thopugh overpriced but worth that much."
1711,This was the only five star hotel that my husband and I stayed at while traveling around India. Everything is extemely clean and spotless throughout the hotel. The staff are very helpful and really seem like they care.
1712,The property location is great and so is the staff and hospitality. The Business Centre was good and services availalbe on time. Only thing to improves is the hotel decor .... it surely needs a makeover!
1713,It was a very pleasant stay at Hyatt during my cousin's wedding in January 2007. Hotel treated us very cordially. We were very happy to be there.
1714,"Hyatt, Delhi is a great property. The rooms are excellent, coffee shop where the B'fast is served in one of the best. Staff are very cordial, they have great membership programme as well."
1715,"The rooms are ofcourse good and that helps in getting up every day morning afresh. The hotel however has a good indian restaurant and when you are travelling to India after quite some time, you are happy with that."
1716,"My husband and I stayed at this beautiful hotel our first night in India. It was a lovely hotel, and was closer to the airport than the downtown hotels. Would highly recommend it."
1717,"Good modern and comfortable room . Great Bed , The Large LCD TV's are smartly placed . 100% recommended. Good modern andfortable room. Great bed, Great TV's. 100% recommend."
1718,"Wifi service goes on and off while you are being charged. Had to change over to broadband with the help of the staff. Room service - I ordered food at 10:30pm, I was told it will be served in 20 mins, it's now 12:24 am and still no food !! I was booked here for two more days, well i've just cancelled my stay here and moving myself to another hotel in delhi."
1719,"I called an hour before reaching the hotel. The central reservation desk was friendly and informed us of the various rooms and told us they had avalibility. We asked for a room at the front desk and were shocked to hear that rooms were not avaliable. At checkout we narrated the story to someone introduced to us as the manager. He apologised but had no explanation. He only offered to compensate by arranging a cab to drop us to the airport for free. We paid 300+ dollars each night, were lied to, treated in most unprofessional manner."
1720,The hotel is still undergoing major refurbishment which means granite blocks are being machined noisily in the reception. The pool was closed to 'guests' throughout our stay whilst they catered for weddings and the like. Drinks were ridiculously expensive £80 or $150 for a medium range bottle of wine and £12 or $22 for a gin and tonic! Our group felt very unwelcome and unwanted.
1721,"The lobby is large and a bit over the top with a lot of black granite and brass; probably inspired by a visit to a Hindu temple filtered through a 1980’s ascetic sensibility. There are well over 500 rooms and many people from Delhi come here for the food, so the property is pretty busy well into the night. It is located in the south part of Delhi so getting to the main part of town for sightseeing is kind of a pain."
1722,"Stopped for a week and also used one of their conference rooms. There were renovations going on but we were well informed and the rooms were clean and tidy. The food and drink was great but very expensive, especially the wine."
1723,The room was clean with hardwood floors and a nice view. Has a good japanese steak house and a great coffee house. But for those singles this place does not have a nit club.
1724,"their service was excellent.all the time they were asking for snax,food,tea etc. and they gave me all that with good manner."
1725,"Our company's team of 9 stayed here for a week and overall we had a good experience. Most of the staff was friendly and helpful and when I asked for a room change to move further away from the public area, they were very accommodating. The italian restaurant was really good and highly recommended when you need a break."
1726,"The hotel does not disclose that it is undergoing renovations anywhere on its website. Despite recent renovations to the room, the mattress sagged and I ended up sleeping in the middle so as not to get a sinking feeling. The hotel also charged me for an airport transfer when I did not use one."
1727,"Reservation was done online, on Hyatt's site but did not have room as per our requirement reserved. Room Service staff could not take order properly. Once I received order it was cold and barely edible."
1728,Stayed 3 nights in a King room. Burned Gold Passport points for 2 of them. Check in was not smooth. Room was not ready and it was after midnight. There are a lot of airline crew that stay here so that is probably why.
1729,"I spent only two days with my mom in this hotel in the end our trip to India. The hotel, restaurants and rooms are nice. It is expensive and the service is poor. The frontdesk was also very rough."
1730,We stayed 2 nights at the Hyatt Regency in New Delhi. Overall the experience was OK but there were several issues which meant I couldn't give this property a higher rating. Our room cards stopped working on the 2nd day and it took two trips to the front desk to sort them out.
1731,"We loved this hotel...Was not inexpensive, but loved everything about it. Staff was very pleasant &amp; helpful. Breakfast was good."
1732,"i like this hotel visit delhi mainly for business and was picked up every morning for work so i really dont know if location is a good one in my opinion there was nothing around or walking distance to see or visitevery restaurant visited was al least 20 minutes by carinside the hotel was perfect :room of good size ,perfectly mantained ,good business services and breakfastnothing to complain about was a joy arriving everyday after a long working day."
1733,"This was my second time at the Hyatt Regency in Delhi - the first time was two years ago and there were some things I didn't like then. This time I stayed a week and I have to say that everything was nearly perfect - nice room, comfortable bed, good restaurants, good service."
1734,"Spent 2 nights, one at top USD, the second using Hyatt Gold Passport points. Excellent bar, excellent buffet breakfast, the top-USD room was small and clean. Gold passport room was smaller, unclean, dirty and lacked furnishings."
1735,If you don’t plan on tipping then I suggest you don't stay at a 4 star up hotel in New Delhi. The hotel is pretty nice over all and yes service is pretty good if you are willing to dump a few Rupees on tips. If you like to be taken to the commission shops be direct and firm with the drive on telling him you want to go to specific places.
1736,This hotel has an excellent standing. The restaurant are good for India. Our oom at the top floor was very well furbished. The sauna was a good point for the evening.
1737,"The service was pretty disorganized, and the location was out of the action of the city. Rooms were okay, but nothing special. Not the cleanest bathroom either."
1738,"The food as always is good, the rooms are pleasant (although can be cold - I turned my ac off!) and the complimentary water is much appreciated. Staff are very helpful on the whole, although a little slow in the restuarant."
1739,"The hotel is located in the heart of the Indian capital, New Delhi. The hotel has a reputation for being one of the best in the city."
1740,"Don't bother scheduling pickup from the airport through the hotel. The price is outrageous. Housekeeping is simply superb, exceptional, fantastic! The beds are luxurious, the bathroom large, the amenities plentiful."
1741,Great Club room. Nice buffet in the evening and breakfast at the Club Lounge. Very good spa with the best ayurvedic massage I've had in India!
1742,"The rooms are nice and comfortable, if slightly dated. The bathroom provides all the basic amenities you would expect to find and more. The service in the hotel is really great and extremely attentive. The food and the service were perfect."
1743,I had been to New Delhi for one night on a trip to get my US VISA from the American Consulate. The hotel and its food is worth the price one pays to stay here.
1744,The Hotel is set between the city centre and the International Airport. On first arrival I thought the outside was nothing special but the welcoming lobby was first class. The restaurants are excellent and whilst I was there the Hotel was adding a new Chinese Restaurant. The pool is not particularly large but adequate and the grounds are well kept.
1745,"The service at the Hyatt is great but, not worth the $300/night price. Our room had a door to an adjoining room through which everything could be heard. Also, when we arrived back home I was sent a letter and bill for food taken out of the mini-bar. This hotel is a total rip-off."
1746,We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Dehli right after Christmas. The food was good and the hotel was great for our kids. I would recommend this hotel for a short stay with children but probably isn't a long term stay.
1747,"The one weakness this hotel had, in my view, was a smaller % of Indian food in the buffet. If you like to stick to traditional Western food, there's plenty of it. The Health Club was well-equipped and machines were always available."
1748,"I would definitely stay at the Hyatt again. My room was quite large with plenty of room around my king bed. When I called the front desk to complain, they sent up a space heater. I had several packages delivered to me and someone from the concierge helped me pack them."
1749,"Restaurant, lots of buffet choice, western or Indian, good quality. Pool, I had a swim, and ordered a beer at the pool, and that was all fine."
1750,"The rooms are small, but adequately sized with a king bed, desk with chair, and easy chair. The service was excellent, so I don't know why other reviewers complained. The weather was unseasonably warm, and there is a dengue fever outbreak in Delhi (over 1300 cases with 50 deaths so far)"
1751,The hotel is not within walking distance of any shops or commercial areas. Breakfast and lunch in the coffee shop were very good. The drop off at the domestic airport was pleasant.
1752,"I always stay at Hyatt's as the name usually guarantee's some kind of standard - not in this case!!! The rooms are very, very old. They have not updated in the basic components such as electrical plugs and the ac, let alone the furnishing. All this would be ok except that they are charging $200. Not worth this at all."
1753,"The Polo lounge was good and the atmosphere lively, but you also have trouble getting a seat in the place. The staff were helpful and attentive and that was the best part I guess. All in all, it was just a average experience."
1754,I couldn't wait to leave this place! On leaving through the lobby I met the hotel manager and told him what was going on in his hotel. He and his team took immediate action to ensure that the remainder of our evening in Delhi was as enkoyable as possible.
1755,"The hotel has a range of facilities, coffee shop, bar, restaurants, gym, and loads of boutiques. Staff were all very polite and helpful with all my queries."
1756,"I stayed here while on business for two weeks and I loved it. The gym and spa were great, and the staff was extremely helpful. The buffet breakfast was included in my rate, and was a nice way to start the day."
1757,"This Hotel is a joke. Out of date product in the mini-bar, rude staff, slow restaurants, expensive drinks, poor transportation, small rooms, ancient bathrooms and basic at that. Wouldn't advise even considering it!!"
1758,"I think I must have stayed at a different hotel than the other reviewers. After 3 weeks on the road in India, we were lucky enough to use points to reserve a room on the club level. The room could have been a bit larger, but the decor, cleanliness and bathroom were are great."
1759,"Staff in Delhi Hyatt are inefficient and extremely rude! They do not know how to treat their customers. Not only that, they need to be fully trained to work at the front desk!"
1760,"Hotel is near the tube/ metro. No frills but reflects the price, you should not pay more than 1200 to 1500 rupees including all taxes."
1761,"Everything it's ok. Room, bathroom, the staff. Good place and good people. They help you with a smile on their faces."
1762,"Hotel is right within easy walking distance to all kinds of shopping as well as to the (excellent) subway station. Food at the roof top restaurant is marginal (we only tried breakfast), but there is an excellent restaurant within walking distance."
1763,I stayed in a budget hotel called Indraprastha at Karol Bagh. For Rs 1740+12.5% tax it was a decent deal (inclusive of Rs 350 for the extra bed and including breakfast which was not that great and served by a very serious guy)
1764,"Hotel in Agra is not the usual standards expected from Intercontinental hotels worldwide. We booked a non-smoking room / floor, but our room stank of stale smoke."
1765,The newly renovated rooms are much nicer than the tired old rooms. The spa/sauna/gym are is excellent. The people in the business centre are very helpful and friendly.
1766,"DONT STAY AT INTERCONTINENTAL EROS -DELHII would like to express my anger concerning my stay at the InterContinental Eros-Hotel in Delhi. As I was with my family I opted to book a suite. When I arrived I was given a room not over looking Lotus temple as promised, but given a stingy damp room."
1767,"I was a bit worried about the mixed reviews I read on here about the IC Nehru Place. Check in was quick and efficent and was taken to our room. As an Ambassador member of IC membership scheme, we were upgraded to an Exec suite. The room was amazing!!! Big in size, the best amenites, two bathrooms, giant fruit basket, fresh flowers everyday."
1768,"This is an average hotel, definitely not a 5 star. The room was ok, but the bath room was bad, needs renovation. Location is a plus, so was the overall service."
1769,"Nice hotel, good service, four restaurant and night club, wonderful was the barber shop with head massage. Relaxing hotel experience."
1770,"I have been staying at this hotel for 4 years now. It's never too full of non-Indian tourists which I always find encouraging. They are starting a renovation process, they are promising a much better hotel. I just hope it doesn't lose it's Delhi charm."
1771,IC-Nehru Place has a convenient location with easy access to domestic airport as well as to Noida. Rooms are a bit outdated with stained carpets but they make it up with good amenities and space.
1772,"Despite an e-mail request, no airport transfer was waiting for me. After over half an hour of haggling at check-in (and a harrowing taxi ride from the airport), I was finally able to retreat to my room. Carpet was stained, furniture was worn, lamps falling of the wall, and the room was just way too old."
1773,"I Booked two rooms in this hotel at the end of June but didn't find hotel as per 5 Star Standard.Lobby is Good,Singh Saheb Restaurant is Good &amp; even Buffet Breakfast was great. Rooms were not Good."
1774,"This is a magnificent hotel, right in the heart iof Delhi's CBD Connaught Place/Barakhamba road. I believe they have one of the two heated swimming pools in all of Delhi with oberoi being the other.Nice restaurents and a lavish breakfast buffet at the coffee shop."
1775,"I stayed this hotel for my business trip, rooms &amp; dinning given good atmosphere and feels like a home. It's a great hotel."
1776,"Staff are excellent, and breakfast is good. The a/c in Blooms Restaurant is set to maximum chill in the evening. The hotel is currently (June 09) undergoing renovation."
1777,"good place warm welcome nice rooms,good food.healthy atmosphere .overall good place to stay if you dont know the place well. Good place to sleep if you don't want to stay in a hotel."
1778,"Hotel was good. But can get better in terms of quality. Checking out process was quite late. Staff is very hospitable, good food and very comfortable rooms."
1779,InterContinental in Delhi is one of the best hotels in the country. The hotel chain has also organised a business event-conference in one of their banquets.
1780,Very good business hotel at the heart of the New Delhi city. Have been there many time before and would recommend this to all colleagues and friends.
1781,"Reasonable business hotel, good value for money. Great if your business is in the Nehru Place of South Delhi area. The hotel is located in the heart of the city's business district. It is located on the banks of the Yamuna River."
1782,Public parts of the hotel are particularly well appointed. The food in the restaurant is delicious and the rooms are well-appointed. The hotel is a good way of spending a sweeper's annual pay on a single night's accommodation.
1783,"Hotel Lobby is good,Restaurants are good, but Rooms are not so good. Kind of rooms with smaller bathroom. Breakfast was too good with lots of items."
1784,"The hotel entrance is grand, has all the facilities of a 5 star, rooms have pool views, very quiet, lovely food in the buffet restaurant. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. Ideal for the airport, nearly 30 minutes drive."
1785,The Intercontinental Eros is a typical city hotel - large and impersonal. Staff are very courteous and the rooms are spic and span. The Singh Sahib does excellent north Indian food and the bar is very relaxing.
1786,"The worst experience ever had in india, the hotel staff member are least bothered abt there guest.Wld never recommend to visit itz a horrible experience."
1787,Intercontinental Eros is in the city center and has a very convenient locaiton. Restaurents offer a variety of cuisine options. Rooms are spacious and elegantly laid out.
1788,"A brilliant hotel, I always stay here when I am in Delhi. In the middle of the city, affordable price and great food."
1789,The hotel is nice. Rooms are comfortable and the dinings options are good. The room can do with some renovation - though it was clean and well maintaned.
1790,"Good luxurious rooms and discounted rates...what else would you want? 2 Hr complimentary Internet. 2 Hrs complimentary Internet 2 H R complimentary Internet, 2 HR complimentary phone service."
1791,The hotel is tired inside and out and in a second class location. The Club Lounge was well below my expectation and the rooms are old-fashioned. And to top it all very poor handling on check-out of an overcharge on my account.
1792,The hotel was a pleasant surprise. Mission control was the room itself. A huge bed made for comfortable sleeping and a playing surface for some family games. The swimming pool was freezing but refreshing.
1793,This hotel oozes with the professionalism of older hotel chains. Service was not perfect in that we had to follow up on a few things. The breakfast buffet served food of the highest quality.
1794,"The InterContinental Nehru Place in Delhi is a very welcome place away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The Executive Club floor (or package) is worth going for as there is a plentiful supply of tea, coffee and chocoaltes all day long. The Club lounge also offers fantastic views from a rooftop balcony overlooking both sides of the hotel."
1795,"The Intercontinental Nehru Place is a five star hotel in Delhi, India. The hotel has two club rooms which were extremely comfortable. The concierge went out of his way to help us with future travel plans."
1796,"Carpets smell musty, the decor is jaded, the rooms are ordinary, the staff seems bored and even the supposed traditional Indian welcome seems contrived. Yes the location is very convenient to check out Delhi. If you are lucky you can get a room with a view to the Lotus temple. But at the price it is a rip off."
1797,"A wonderful place to stay that has thought through every apsect of a stay and has taken care of every detail. We were there 3 days/2 nights found it to be a great place to sleep, eat, meet , work and relax."
1798,"great hotel, great facilities there, allways ready to help, less time consuming services, great food. Great food, great service. Great hotel."
1799,"The hotel is well maintained, the staff is very professional and is eager to help. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. The 24-hour fitness facility is well equipped with treadmills, ellipticals, stairmasters and a variety of weight machines."
1800,The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms very nice and new. The buffet breakfast is a vacation in its own right. The hotel operates a taxi hire service where you can hire a taxi to take you around the city.
1801,"Hi, this is Prince - really i like the services of this hotel coz we have already operated one chartered plain Qantas of 220 peoples. I want to say that hotels services was good from front office bell desk to sales person...thanks CHEERSPrince9899000220."
1802,"Excellent service, friendly but not imposing staff. Room high standard but bathroom a little tired with cracked plastic bath. Food generally good, but after a sandwich in the tea lounge I was struck down the same evening with the notorious Delhi Belly."
1803,"This hotel is absolutely fabulous...Very Grand and the service is brilliant. The moment you walk into the hotel, you are transferred into a frenzy of senses, smell, sound, sight - all very authentic and indian."
1804,Stayed here for a week in June 2008. Car and driver to and from airport was an excellent complimentary service. Food in the Indian restaurant and breakfast was excellent. Would stay again.
1805,Staff very good- competent and charming. Food at breakfast and in Indian restaurant good. Rooms quite spacious and clean. We have just returned from two over night stays at this hotel.
1806,We stayed at this hotel as part of a Golden Triangle trip. This was the friendliest and best appointed hotel of our trip. The evening buffet was super - especially the chef's made to order dosa.
1807,"The hotel was spotless, the food excellent and the staff were very professional. We stayed again at the end of our tour just to wind down before the return home."
1808,"This hotel was booked for us by a travel agent. After being a very busy tour for 4 days I welcomed relaxing in the luxurious room. My only complaint is that after lunch in the lobby lounge, I was knocked out for the rest of my stay."
1809,The hotel is very clean and modern. The pool are area is very large and pleasant. The rooms are a decent size and have most of the amenities required.
1810,Very clean hotel with lots of marble and modern design. Several restaurants to choose from but only sampled main buffet restaurant which was pretty average. Mostly Indian food with small choice of international dishes.
1811,"Nice Hotel but in a single room you never sleep along, as hotel is being restructured, mice run around rooms, good luck. Hotel is in central London."
1812,My company booked this hotel for me. I checked in and asked for a quiet room. they gave me room 708 and it was very noisy. All the rooms are the same as they are all exposed to the outside roads.
1813,"Hong Kong hotel is 20 out of 10, this one is 0. room is so old and tired no life in it carpet had stains on itbed is sagging no shower in the bathroom. Want to go out of hotel and see or buy something but also no shops or anything nearby to see."
1814,"You buy a day pass at the gym for the pool which allows you to use the lockers, showers etc and they give you a towel. There is always a chocolate fountain on the dessert table which is delicious."
1815,"When I got home I found that my credit card had been charged TWICE for my stay. I settled my bill in full when I left, and that charge was on my statement. But an identical charge was ALSO on my statements, dated a few days later. So the hotel double-charged me."
1816,This is such a fantastic 5 star hotel. So beautiful and sparkling clean with fantastic service and food. Spa and gym is great and they have a beautiful outdoor pool. If you do not have a reason to be closer to the city this is a good choice.
1817,"The Intercontinental Nehru Place is a plush, comfortable, quiet hotel. Delhi is expensive, and hotels are often poor value. This hotel is not cheap (around $230 after taxes), but it's a good value for Delhi."
1818,"i stay there only one night, but to use wireless in the hotel not possible, when i did the check out they forget to charge me some phone calls, so i advise than about it, we lost about 20minutes to find the phone calls. i hope next time stay in other place more thurst."
1819,"Clean, tidy and polite staff, from the bell boy to the duty manager nothing was too much. India is expensive currently as there is a shortage of good quality hotel rooms."
1820,"The staff at this hotel even knew my name. Anything I wanted, they were more than happy to help with. The room was large and comfortable. The towels were so soft. The food from the “coffee shop” was also outstanding."
1821,"Superb staff, clean and efficient, great restaurants. Not quite so central but you always use taxi anyway and it is a price worth paying for this real quality."
1822,"The room they put me in is above an intersection of 3 streets and as anyone knows who has been to India, on the streets they honk their car horns constantly. The front control panel is missing from the television. Wireless internet is advertised but the wireless does not connect."
1823,"Stayed at this property twice, and had a fabulous stay both times. On Xmas morning stockings were left on our door, filled with cookies and candies for the kids and miniature liquor bottles for the adults. The club lounge is very comfortable, with very nice attentive staff."
1824,"The front desk at this hotel is terrible. They don't know what they are doing. I booked thru Orbitz and my reservation was fully paid for before I arrived. When I went to check out, they said that they didn't receive my payment from Orbitz yet."
1825,"The rooms are lovely, furnished well and with a super bathroom. The bed was definitely the highlight- it was like sinking in to a cloud! Unfortunately with a hotel of this price the facilities of the hotel were also very expensive, to the point of being unreasonable."
1826,"This hotel made up for the hassles and substandard facilities that I had to endure prior to checking into the IC. It's a nice business-class hotel, and I thought it was tourist-friendly as well. No problems in check-in/out, professionally handled. I loved the public areas and the lovely bakery."
1827,Rooms are nice and clean and beds are made twice a day. Staff is always wanting to go extra mile to help the customers. Only drawback is distance from the international airport which is about 45-60 minutes drive.
1828,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel in October for 5 nights and found it to be excellent. We had a package for our whole trip to Delhi/Agra and everything went like clockwork. The breakfast buffet choices were extensive, and every taste was catered for."
1829,"The meals were good at the restaurants, they had an ATM close by, and the facilities including the spa were very nice. One of the main problems on our floor (5th), is that they must have just re-varnished all the woodwork on that floor. The fumes were overwhelming to the point of nausea."
1830,"Staff are desperately in need of some training. Rooms were clean; comfy beds; massage and spa were great. Great big and clean pool. For the price and quality of facilities, I would stay here again over the Imperial Hotel."
1831,"I stayed at this hotel about a year ago and had loved its location. It was a good experience then, the staff was friendly, the services easily comparable to any other five star in Asia and pretty good value for money. This year due to sheer convenience I once again stayed there. I tried their chinese restaurant this time...I was thrilled by the authentic cuisine put together by an actual chef from East Asia."
1832,"The rooms are good, and clean. The pillow menu is a nice touch, as is the choice in the room of both feather and synthetic pillows. I never did get the Internet access in the rooms to work."
1833,Me and my Family were more than pleased to be met at the main porch right at the Taxi. The Manager at the reception with red tie offered me a complimentary juice and welcomed me back home.
1834,"Stayed for 3 days. Room service- excellent. Some reception staff very cool,some get very stressed. 24 hour restaurant -you can still see flies allover. music too loud for conversation."
1835,We had 2 rooms for 3 days during an off-peak season. Our price was quite good (6580 Rupees plus tax). The only substantial problem we had was the air conditioning didn't work in one of our rooms.
1836,"Warm and cozy rooms, plush interiors, nice service and tasty food. Good connectivity for business and tour planner available in the hotel. Nice service for the value paid."
1837,Whilst the hotel is very plush and elegant it still had that comfy feeling. We were made very welcome and nothing was too much trouble.
1838,Great place to stay in Delhi. Hotel is designed with class and ambience. Had meals in quite a few of the restaurants and all of them were superb. Even tried the Bill Clinton meal in one!
1839,The room was so cramp it was the worst room out of all the others we stayed in. Some work started in the early hours in our next room and there was banging all night. It cost nearly double than all the other hotels.
1840,"One of the nicest hotels. Excellent partys, lots of young people, the only place u can eat good food 24/7."
1841,The executive floor was nice but not nearly as spectacular from food availability as other executive floors around the world. The large outside pool was perfect for an afternoon reprieve from the August Indian heat. It is impossible to get into the hotel without having your car checked and luggage x-rayed and body searched.
1842,"My father and I stayed at the Maurya when in Delhi. The Bukhara is an old tradition of mine and yes, while it may be sometimes erratic in quality, I still love it. The coffee shop has an excellent spread for breakfast."
1843,"i stayed at this hotel, booked from the internet, all though december is high season. rooms are large and comes with all mod cons of five star hotel. staff were lot friendly and always knew my name."
1844,The most famous resutrant in this hotel is bukhara and dal bhukara is the delicacy ( takes around 12 hrs to make it) The main gallery slips into a host of luxary shopping stores.
1845,"Hotel rooms are very well decorated, very clean and trendy. Food at the main restaurant was really outstanding. Staff was great with little delays for the check out."
1846,As far as I can see every 5* hotel in India is amazing. This hotel was more so as it literally had everything you could ever need. Food and bars very good and very entertaining.
1847,Just returned from my jurney in India. I had two seperate stays at Maurya and my general impression is that there is some space for improvements left. It might be that some thinks changed due to recession but failures which shouldn't happened includes.
1848,"The service and the rooms are of excellent quality and certainly as expected fo any 5 star hotel in the world. The rooms are very clean, modern, well featured and above all very comfortable. The hotel has most features you would expect like a swimming pool and spa and has numerous top notch restaurants."
1849,"Stayed here for 5 nights in July for business. Nice location in a quite part of the town (Diplomatic Enclave) Large, clean rooms with good amenities. Molton Brown bath products a nice touch of luxury."
1850,"I stayed at the Maurya Sheraton in September, 1984. I LOVED it! It was beautiful and one could really experience Indian culture. I had excellent service . I took a cab in every day to be with friends in Vijay Nagar."
1851,"Located in the heart of Diplomatic enclave this hotel in very convenient for meetings with politicians. Food was great as usual, delicious, vibrant display and great variety. Price is surprisingly low as compared to other well known business hotels."
1852,The rooms were spacious and very clean. The hotel is a little way from the the sights - short cab ride its well worth to sometimes escape and be in a relaxing environment.
1853,Bukhara Hotel is located in the heart of London. The hotel is located on the banks of the River Thames. The restaurant is called bukhara and serves Indian food. The food is exceptional.
1854,"Stayed at Maurya hotel for 2 days. On my arrival day, I had some time over and could enjoy the pool. On one night, I needed cash for the day after and reception send their car to take me to nearest ATM."
1855,"I stayed in Maurya, as part of my business visit to Delhi. The room's warm colors give you a sense of peace and comfort. Each room has its own mini-bar - stocked with the best alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks."
1856,The Maurya has the best selection of North Indian food. The shopping arena in the hotel is open at unearthly hours. The attention to detail in the restaurants is wonderful.
1857,Stayed for a night and honestly was left a tad bit disappointed. Food in the chinese was exp and ok. The room was big but didn't care much for it.
1858,One of good hotels in New-Delhi.Excellent Location.Nearby to India Gate.Located near to all Embassies. One of the best hotels in the city.
1859,"The ITC Maurya has all the facilities (gym, pool, spa) that you will need to feel comfortable. Rooms were very clean with excellent attention to detail. Business center offered free internet use."
1860,"The hotel has a class of its own with very modern looks of rooms, the staff is very prompt, the service is very good and every minute details is taken care off when you stay with them. Has very good choice of food with very good Indian style restaurant."
1861,I am frequent traveler to Delhi and had the opportunity to stay at this iconic hotel. The rooms are fantastic. the re-done bathrooms with clean lines are nice. the modern looks make it truly on par with any other 5 star hotel room.
1862,"Great location in the Diplomatic Enclave. Terrific food and theme restaurants. A great coffee shop. Speedy, efficient service. The hotel is one of the most happening in India."
1863,The hotel ambience is fantastic. The room was good and I really enjoyed the spread of the breakfast buffett. I really liked everything about the hospitality which the hotel provided.
1864,The experience at Maurya was bad to say the least. It looked like a cheap hotel which hasn't been maintained for ages. The food was pretty good but overall the place was bad.
1865,During business stay they provide all luxury and comforts which really miss in other place. Good food and warmth service are the tool which fetch you again and again in Hotel Mouya.
1866,one of the best hotels in Delhi with positive vibes and always look lively. The BEST HOSPITALITY never found any where else in the world.
1867,The best part of my stay at ITC was that they never let me feel that i was away from my home and looked after my comfort.
1868,"Maurya, in many respects, is ahead of the times. It hosts one of India's first discotheques. Service is speedy and efficient. Food at all the restaurants is great."
1869,"The Maurya is one of Delhi's most popular five-star hotels. The hotel is located in the heart of the city, but is out of the way. The rooms are very modern and the spa rates are astronomical."
1870,"Maurya is one of the best hotels in Delhi. The hotel has a huge central Pavilion. The rooms have a 32 inches LCD TV, cozy bed &amp; variety of fruits and snacks."
1871,It was offical conference organised by my organisation which included introduction to PDMS. It was a full day conference with deligates from wide variety of industries. I had a very delicious indian food. Overall Wonderful day's stay at sheraton.
1872,"The hotel was classy and the service was excellent. The highlight, of course, was the food at Bukhara and Dum Pukth. The only disappointed was an extra bed that we had asked for."
1873,The Sheraton Murya Hotel in New Delhi is a Starwood property. The Bukhara Restaurant is probably the best Indian food I have ever eaten. Try the kebabs and all the tandoori dishes.
1874,The Maurya Sheraton is one of the most luxurious hotels in the city. The hotel has a beautiful mural dome in the lobby which witnesses hundreds of business meetings.
1875,The rooms are large spacious and well done up. The spa is fantastic and so is the swimming pool. The Dum Pukht and Bukhara are easily two of the finest restaurants for Indian cuisine in Delhi.
1876,An awesome Mughal Experience... This is what I call Dining in Style... The food tastes so delicious here at this restaurant that people should be careful not to eat their own fingers!!
1877,"Spent 3 nights there while on a wedding ceremony in Delhi &amp; Kathmandu. Staff is professional and very keen to help you. Food is excellent, though we only had breakfast from the huge buffet and one dinner."
1878,Dal Bukhara is one of the poshest restaurant of New Delhi. Most of the foreign country ministries stays there during their visit to India.
1879,"The attention to detail in each room is perfect. Nothing is there that does not work, and everything you need is in place from the get go. Service is impeccable and totally reliable."
1880,It is one of the most comforting hotes with nice rooms and excellent food. It always nice to come and visit the hotel and stay there.
1881,"My Humble House is part of the Tung Lok Group, which have many award winning restaraunts in Singapore and Taipei. I would probably stay here again purely for the dining options, as this hotel also houses the famed Bukhara and Dum Pukt."
1882,"I had gone to maurya to attend a family function. I must say its d best hotel Ive visisted so far. The ambience was awesome, the food sumptuous and the decor was great."
1883,"The hotel has hosted some of the most famous dignitarties including Bill Clinton. The massage chair, the jacuzzi tub in the bathroom, the music system are my favourites."
1884,"Good loyalty program, the Welcomaward. Happy hours, at the Towers lounge is worth mentioning as excellent. Excellent restaurants- The Bhukara is the best in India."
1885,"For the business traveler to Delhi, it is the perfect hotel. Conveniently located, good facilities, nice food. I particularly liked the massage chair in the room and the music system."
1886,This is one hotel property i love to go to time and again. Recommend a stay at this hotel to anyone who wants to be close to the great food at Mauyra.
1887,The Maurya is a grand hotel near the diplomatic area of New Delhi. The highlight of the hotel are its two restaurants The Bukhara and Dum Pukht. Both serve different but unique kinds of Indian cuisine.
1888,"The room was very well - just right temperature &amp; right lux for the retiring eyes after a stressful day. More importantly the Indianness in the ambience all around, shows the great heritage of India."
1889,Bhukara and Dhum Pukt are v. expensive but excellent restaurants. Bfast is average. Only drawback is constant problems with internet access.
1890,"The Murya is in the Luxury Collection of Starwood properties. The hotel also hosts many conferences, seminars as well as receives dignities from around the world."
1891,"Stayed here one night for business in the Towers section of the hotel. Room was nice with all the amenities. Enjoyed the Dublin Bar happy hour with co-workers from 6-8 PM. My biggest complaint was the gym, if you want to call it that."
1892,The rooms at this hotel were great. I only had trouble with check-in and service in general. I think it would be better to stay at the Sheraton in Saket which is cheaper as well as newer.
1893,"wonderful hotel. stayed in a towers room which was a little small but the quality of the room and elec toys made up for it. massive flat screen tv. good choice of restaurants, make sure you visit the Bukhara Restaurant, amazing food. Overall kind of expensive place to stay but most 5 * in Delhi are."
1894,"The Maurya is one of the best hotels in Delhi. The spa, the head massage was excellent. The breakfast buffet was outstanding and the staff happy and helpful."
1895,Hotel looks spectacular and seems to be a favourite of Delhi's rich and famous. Staff very friendly and efficient. Bukhara is a top-rated restaurant which you have to experience.
1896,Stayed at the Executive Level in a newly renovated room. Good size room with stable internet connection. Nice bathroom with a glass separation to the bedroom.Breakfast buffet offers good choice in Western and Indian food.
1897,My gmail account was blocked by the archimedian internet. Some of our reservations were invisible at check-in. Food hygiene is not a priority here. Getting staff to do anything is often impossible due to demarcation.
1898,The ITC Maurya is one of the most expensive hotels in Ireland. The hotel is not an easy walk from any other shops or restaurants. There is a separate floor for single female guests.
1899,"Stayed for 1 night in the hotel for a recent business trip. As it was a last minute booking, I have no choice but to book directly from the hotel and was booked in a deluxe suite paying a hefty USD630 per night. Definitely the most expensive hotel I have stayed in!!!!! Then again hotels in India are never cheap which is a sharp contrast to the poverty scattered in the city."
1900,"Stayed at this hotel for two nights at the beginning of March. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable with supersoft pillows. Breakfast was served upstairs and there was a good choice."
1901,Dubya stays here when he comes to New Delhi...the US Embassy and other diplomatic facilities are just around the corner. There is a wide array of shops in the hotel and I brought back several beautiful silk scarves for my wife.
1902,Stayed at this hotel for 3 weeks in September of 2007 for work. Room was not very large but sufficient for one person. Staff was very nice and were very eagar to help. Dublins is a Irish bar which turns into a club at night.
1903,Booking and checkin were very smooth. Bathroom/showers and closet areas were excellent. Breakfast buffet was excellent with a great Indian/Western selection.
1904,Mints and candies were available on the desk and the Rajput unifoirmed doormen took care of our bags. The towers rooms are newly decorated with dark wood accents.
1905,Bukhara was one of the best Indian meals we have ever had anywhere in the world. A very short overnight stay so didn't get to enjoy most of the hotel's facilities.
1906,Executive rooms were very nice (not very big though). Very well equipped and very clean. Staff was very friendly and helpfull. Main restaurant is very nice place to have lunch or dinner.
1907,We stayed here twice each for one night during out stay in India. My first room was very small and cramped but I was upgraded for my second room to a much larger room with a seating area and huge bathroom. The best part about this hotel however is the Bukhara tandoori restaurant.
1908,"We stayed here for a conference in Delhi and LOVED it. Our room was called a Garden View Deluxe suite and was actually the size of two hotel rooms. Rooms were modern (flat screen Plasma TVs), luxurious bedding, fantastic air conditioning."
1909,"We had a great experience here. Wonderful, updated room with a great bathroom. This was definitely one of the best rooms we had in India. The buffet is also very good."
1910,The tiny menu forces you to choose from the limited choices they provide. The waiters seem as if they have never waitered before. Different ones come to ask for a drinks order and a dessert order twice.
1911,"The room was clean with a very comfortable bed, service was acceptable, and breakfast buffet was serviceable. It is a short (20 minute) drive to the airport for approximately $20/hotel sedan."
1912,Stayed here for a week for business. I was told my room was upgraded at check-in. Breakfast buffet (included with room) is really good.
1913,"The room rate was nearly $500/night and, in my opinion, quite overpriced. This hotel is not at all like other hotels in its price range, like the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental."
1914,We booked through SPG and had the option of the Meriden or Sheraton. We chose Meriden for our first night and then Sheraton for the 2 separate stays we planned during our golden triangle tour. On our first stay ( 1 night ) we had the unfortunate experience of being there at the same time as government officials were holding some sort of conference. We booked a club room which meant we could have complimentary cocktails in the evening.
1915,needed an extra night in delhi and the Hyatt staff booked me in here Great result - stayed on the refurbed 4 th Floor - The Bakhara restaurant is in the top 35 restaurants in the world - and superb the tandoor lamb is fantastic - Great room - nice environment - staff very helpful - would go back !
1916,"The staff at the Maurya Sheraton were so incredibly helpful to us in our little crisis. They went so above and beyond for us, advising us on the steps necessary to get our act together. Plus, we spent quite a while lounging around the lobby and it was very pretty. Overall, we highly recommend this hotel!"
1917,"The hotel staff was incomparable in terms of friendliness, efficiency and knowledge. The buffet breakfast was sumptuous and enough to keep me going the entire day. The hotel fitness center was one of the best I've encountered."
1918,"After tax, my 1 night was $500. Ouch. Great room, nice interior, outside is sort of ugly, but who cares. Free breakfast (omlette...maybe best i've ever had) Only complaint is the $15 internet fee."
1919,"I booked this hotel on their website and stayed for 8 days in Jan. 07. The booking process was not without glitches ,probably because of the fact that I got a room in the Sheraton Tower, located in an annexe of the main Maurya hotel. On the basis of that experience,I would call it the most overpriced and overrated restaurant in the world."
1920,"I would definitely stay here every time I am in Delhi. Full buffet breakfast is also included, and if you are in the ITC One rooms, you can enjoy it in your room. too. Bukhara is just superb."
1921,"Stayed at this hotel for the 3rd time this year, this time for a week due to a conference at the hotel. Rooms were often not cleaned until very late in the day, and one day I had to call several times for service. There is no record of my guest history from this hotel despite previous stays."
1922,"The Maurya is home to the top restaraunt in Delhi - Bhukara. Be sure to befriend a bartender at the Polo Lounge or make reservations a week in advance if you want a shot at a table. The Dublin bar is fun, but they have trouble admitting they aren't a nightclub."
1923,"The hotel was excellent in some areas and unsatisfactory in others. The service was impeccable. The buffet breakfast is one of the best I've ever had. On the other hand, they are doing construction at the moment."
1924,"In the winter of 2005-6, my wife and I stayed at the Maurya Sheraton on 3 separate occasions; twice in the Tower section, and once in the Club section. The Club was a bit cheaper ($275.00US) and we were lucky to get the newly renovated 12th floor. The best part of staying at the Towers is the butler service."
1925,The Jaypee Siddharth was selected by my business representative in Bangalore. The location was good with a HDFC Bank with a 24 hour ATM 1/2 block to the east along the elevated metro line. The pool seems to have had a recent upgrade and was a welcome surprise.
1926,"The Jaypee is a small but elegant lobby, with a bar and restaurant attached. The restaurant and bar definitely give it a 5-star type of quality, very westernized. Great food, excellent service. No slippers, no robes, and no alarm clocks in the room."
1927,Jaypee Siddharth is one of the finest five star hotel in New Delhi. The hotel's proximity to the Connaught Place by 3kms has made it a preferred stay option.
1928,"Amazing is the word. Wonderful hotel, wonderful ambience and wonderful staff. What a place..a treat for everybody...a treat to everybody."
1929,"Hotel Siddharth has almost all the required facilities like Swimming Pool, Doctor On call , and the most thing i liked about the hotel is the comfortability and quality of food. The lobby was beautiful and the staff very friendly , in fact the whole hotel had a nice ambience about it."
1930,"Foyer was modern and welcoming, reception was efficient and our room was clean and comfortable. The food was good, including afternoon tea and delicious cakes from the patisserie off the foyer. The location of the hotel is never going to win prizes but was fairly close to the sights of New and Old Delhi."
1931,Jaypee is a mid-priced hotel in Delhi. The room is spacious for two people and the air conditioning works fine. The breakfast was pretty good as well with made-to-order eggs.
1932,The general appearance of the hotel is very nice. I had read the reviews advising to avoid this hotel. The agent booked it contraryto my request and advised that the refurbishment was completed. IT IS NOT.
1933,"The City Park Hotel is a much better, less expensive alternative. This hotel is under renovation and you had to access the elevator from the next level (not fun with suit cases). The air condition did not work all of the time throughout the entire building."
1934,"Location is central, but that means also noisy. Some rooms are still not renovated, look like 15-20 years old. If you take an omelette or fried eggs, you have to pay it extra!"
1935,"I had the misfortune of staying in this god-forsaken hotel in the midst of chaos in Feb 3 and 4, 2007. I hope readers of this review will never stay in any of the Jaypee hotels as the Clarks Shiraz in Agra was the same."
1936,"The room we had was refurbished and extremely nice with flat screen tv and waterfall shower. The view out the window was terrible - construction. No double beds were apparently available. The restaurant plays extremely loud, obnoxious techno music in the mornings."
1937,I stayed in this hotel on November 11th 2006. The room had a tea/coffee making facility which was nice. The bell boys and door staff at the hotel were very helpful. The hotel needs a proper internet service (it does have one but it is in somebody's office) and it needs an ATM.
1938,"Do yourself a favor and NOT stay at this hotel! For the price they charge, you can stay at a much nicer hotel. The smell, are small, and the staff is rude. Would definately not suggest."
1939,We stayed at this hotel for one night passing through Delhi on the way to Agra. It is quite old fashioned and drab inside although a sign outside states that refurbishments are in progress. There was a terrrible smell in the corridor and to my disgust I found that the room smelled exactly the same. I wouldn't stay in this hotel again as it's simply not worth the money.
1940,Hotel ok if a little sanitised but some of the staff who work on reception are unbelievably arrogant &amp; rude. An improvement on return visit when it appeared a change in reception staff but even these were not what I would expect.
1941,"Stayed at the JP Siddartha August 2004. Service, food, room and ambience are all excellent. Location isn't brilliant as there is little to visit within walking distance."
1942,We stayed one night only at this hotel as it was closer to the airport. We were greeted by a charming girl...but once she was gone there was not one friendly face.
1943,I have been staying in this hotel for the last 2 years. Rooms are ok but menu needs to increase at Eggspectation. The horrible thing is the hotel does not respect its guests.
1944,Amazing breakfast spread at Eggspectation. Service needs to improve a bit though. Had stayed at The Grand in the same area but stayed away as heard it had caught fire some time back.
1945,Punjab By Nature is a good place to get a tasty curry at a fair price. The rooms are basic but clean. A large screen TV provides lots of channels to choose from in English.
1946,"The hotel tariff is reasonable and have all facilities Viz. secretarial services, conference facilities and health club. The environment is excellant. The food and the service provided is very good."
1947,"The hotel is magnificent and we experienced very prompt service. Almost entire hotel is non smoking zone, the space alloted for smokers was open &amp; very very hot. There were three different restaurants inside the hotel giving choice within Chinese, Indian, Continental categories."
1948,"Ambience PerfectFood : a must try for chicken dishesRooms : Luxurious,spaciousEnvironment is just so perfect for staying and especially when you are stressed down with work."
1949,Rooms are fantastic. Service is proffessional and staff is courteious. Only area that may be improved is the menu of Buffet Breakfast.
1950,"I have stayed here for more than 5 times ... and ambience here absolutely great...During IPL season - I i was staying along with Deccan chargers team and we could meet Gilchrist, Laxman, Gibbs etc.Suite room with complimentry wine will give pleasant sleep after tiresome business hours...Review by JP # 9W 111061985"
1951,Stayed at Jaypee Vasant Delhi when on a Page &amp; Moy Tour during Oct 08. As part of a 30 person group we enjoyed excellent service co-ordinated by our tour manager. Restaurants at the hotel were varied in cuisine offering different styles and excellent quality.
1952,Jaypee Vasanth is located in the heart of the city. The food quality is excellent and the happy hours are enjoyable. The only disturbing point was the renovation work going on in the hotel at that point of time.
1953,I stayed in the hotel for a week when I first shifted to Delhi-2 weeks back. The location is great and everything you need is a mere 2 minutes walk. My room overlooked the pool and I saw quite a bit of green which was a pleasant surprise.
1954,"The hotel is situated on a busy corner within a suburb of Delhi. Despite promising first impressions on entering the hotel, this hotel was very disappointing. Several problems occurred during my stay."
1955,Hotel was selected for its peaceful ambience for a last evening in Delhi prior to flying out the following morning. The meal we had in the Restaurant ranked as one of the best of our trip.
1956,"A nice hotel. Not exceptional but clean, comfortable, good service and reasonable price. Probably better classified as a good 4 star rather than 5 star."
1957,"The hotel has a beautiful entrance and lobby, with the main restaurant leading off to one side and the bar to the other. The rooms are of a decent size, with all the normal facilities, very comfortable bed. A very poor hanging area in the wardrobe, constrained by the safe deposit box."
1958,"Most helpful and frindly staff!Excellent restaurants. Expensive, but quality &amp; service justify the price. Pool environment does not very much invite to the -impeccable clean- pool."
1959,"Hotel Vasant Continental is a wonderful hotel. They have a nice little gym, yoga classes, spa and salon, and great restaurant. The location just next to the Vasant Priya cinema is ideal."
1960,"Rooms were clean and staff friendly. Breakfast was included in our stay which was at a nice restaurant within the hotel. The local area is quite good as it is right next to hotel, a few restaurants."
1961,"Located in south delhi, this hotel is a bit away from the business quarter. Rooms are adequate and service is what one would expect in a business-oriented hotel. A good chinese cuisine restaurant was a surprise."
1962,We stayed in Jaypee Vasant Continental just for a night in transit between International and domestic flight. Hotel itself was clean and nice. Room was also well maintained and room-service was prompt and food was of good quality. Only thing that I didnt like was that while checking in we were treated very well- however while checking out they didnt even bother to pick our luggage and help with cab esp given that we were with an infant.
1963,"Stayed here last week because all other hotels were booked. Hotel was pleasant surprise, as it was in a quiet area and had good food (though expensive) and newly refurbished and clean rooms."
1964,Recently renovated and modern. Excellent buffet style b'fast. Good in room dining. Two computers is inadequate and the service should be included with the room rate.
1965,The hotel is very conviniently located at the middle circle on CP. One has to climb 2-3 flights of stairs to reach the room. Insist for discount &amp; upto 20% of the tariff will be waived.
1966,"Stayed at one other hotel in the same area, in comparison, this seemed more deserving of the &quot;mid-range&quot.; or 2-3 star designation. The rooms were larger than the other hotel; the bathroom was cleaner and larger. The beds were clean and comfy. Internet access was pricey but available."
1967,Very overpriced. Rooms are ok but no great shakes. Staff are not helpful and are just trying to sell you services. All you want is some honesty but all they want is your money.
1968,"Our room was clean and comfortable. Seemed overpriced, but this was the only hotel we stayed at. We were referred to a travel agency by the hotel, Perfect Holiday Travels, that was full of touts. Do not trust this hotel with any of your travel arrangements."
1969,"I paid about $80 for one night here (the Connaught location) in November. It's not awful, but I paid about half the price for other hotels in India that were far nicer with better service than this one."
1970,"Hotel Jukaso Inn in Connaught Place is one of India's most expensive hotels. Hotel room was dirty, small, and didn't have a window. Hotel service was poor."
1971,"I booked at the Jukaso Inn after reading a favorable review in Frommers Guide Book. I booked into the downtown, Connaught Circle location. The hotel was really nothing special, nor terrible. Just average."
1972,"Great hotel, excellent location (centrally located in New Delhi), close to Connaught Place. Interior visible through the glass lifts is adds to the excitement. The rooms are excellent, nicely done up."
1973,"I Stay there for a bussiness trip from my company. Room was a nice one with TV, comfertable bed with pillow, mood lighting and many more."
1974,"Le Meridien Delhi is one of the most beautiful hotels in the city. The spa was amazing - we had two massages, and if you are feeling romantic the couples room with private hot tub is worth the extra £25. Monsoon the Indian restaurant was fabulous."
1975,I have stayed at this hotelabout 3 times in last 2 years and the serivce at hotel is always great.Location is great.We enjoy our stay here everytime.
1976,"spent a quality time in delhi with my wife and I really like room hotel all environment,specially room service, Pub and restaurant."
1977,Ranks on the higher end of Le Meridien's that I've stayed at. I was satisfied by my stay and the value and service.
1978,"Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in two different rooms. Clean, modern hotel with good design throughout. Staff were very helpful as you would hope/expect in a hotel of this class/price."
1979,Le Meridien is like an oasis in New Delhi! The hotel was my favourite place in the city! Friendly staff. Very safety. I prefer The One restaurant because of the not chili food :)
1980,"I stayed here always when I visited New Delhi. The lobby is amazing; futuristic style. Room is great and spacious, beautiful bathroom. Well designed and modern; Exquisite."
1981,"The hotel is currently under renovation, which means jackhammers and workmen throwing stuff out windows. The power went off (and on again) multiple times while I was there. The room had no bath, only a shower with a barely-controllable nozzle. The hotel's pool area was a real gathering place for hot birds."
1982,"The hotel is located in the city centre area, but the room rate is surprisingly low, and staffs are nice. I took a buffet dinner on the ground floor cafe, the food is good, but it cost you US$70 per person."
1983,"great hotel, very modern interior, spacious and airy. colonial decor but with great food and great view over delhi.down side would be lack of fast free internet acces, poor pool and sundeck area."
1984,Staff is amazingly helpful and take care of elderly people too as i noticed couple of girls in atrium...was touched by it. Their new Indian restaurant monsoon is one of its own.
1985,I have staying in this hotel whenever I am in Delhi but I have experienced some irritations. The hotel did not send a limo to the airport because my PA did not inform them. Security check has been stepped up. I love this but to surrendder my swiss knife shows lack of discretion.
1986,"Great service, great food, excellent rooms and a good location. Checkins are always quick and the room is always just right. Overall a great hotel with superb facilities."
1987,The hotel caters well for business and leisure travellers. The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated. The breakfast is buffet-style and tasty. The coffee they use is tasteless and instant.
1988,"The room I had was excellent--apparently recently renovated. Room service was attentive and housekeeping was diligent. They provided complimentary water, which is very important for Delhi. The swimming pool, however, is not that clean, even if not many people use it."
1989,I stayed in the hotel with my associates for a few days of meetings. I do not have any complaints at all. The room was of a comfortable size. Perhaps the only complaint here is that the wardrobe was rather small.
1990,"I stayed here for three nights during a business trip and felt that the service let the hotel down. I was left with the impression that the convenience for staff comes before guest requirements. I had problems with my booking confirmation, changing rooms and hotel car service."
1991,This is a great place for those who want a hotel that helps them forget they are in India. Colleagues were disappointed that there was no attempt to showcase anything Indian. This is less a hotel for tourists than for business travelers.
1992,"Stayed two night here while temperatures were above 42C in the city - this very much felt like an oasis. Decor was superb with imported italian glass tiles everywhere. Rooms were in excellent shape, large and beautifully done."
1993,We went there on our wedding night and stayed for a few days after. Staff were lovely and friendly and happy to help in anyway possible. They even had Tom and Jerry playing on the TV screens on the lift and lobby.
1994,We conducted our Business get together for some of our esteemed clients and friends for getting our Master Card Certification. We enjoyed the hall and nice dinner buffet arrangement. It was a wonderful evening.
1995,Air conditioning next to useless and floors in the room creak so loudly when you walk on them that everyone wakes up. Every member of staff wants to be tipped - quite why I do not know as they do not offer any form of service. Everything is expensive from car hire to food yet nothing is worth the money.
1996,The hotel is located on the top floor of a building. The rooms are comfortable and the restaurant has great views of the city. The service is excellent and the rooms are well-appointed.
1997,Stayed on a business trip for one night. Was impressed by the design &amp; the bold statement the hotel makes. Service was impeccable. Just right for a business traveller.
1998,best available hotel in delhi. located in the heart of delhi very near to caunnut place and india gate. as per the reputation rooms are very execellent and the service are very prompt.
1999,"this is my favorite biz hotel while in Delhi. Newly renovated, big size rooms and bathrooms, good breakfast. But it could do with little better housekeeping."
2000,"Stayed on business during a hectic trip. Nice location, actually able to get out and walk somewhere which is unusual for a 5* in India. Pool area disappointing though. Service etc first class."
