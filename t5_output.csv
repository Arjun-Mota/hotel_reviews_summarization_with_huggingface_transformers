,summarization
0,"we spent two separate nights at this hotel as part of our tour of india. the hotel is heavily used by and geared to tour groups, but there are a lot of arrivals and departures in the night and early morning, which may be disturbing to individual travellers. we would not hesitate to return for an overnight stay."
1,"the hotel and rooms (although large) are characterless. service in the restaurant was OK, as was the food. when we arrived at midnight we were unable to get a beer - bar closed and no beers in mini-bar!"
2,road works when i was there so getting to and from was a problem but was over come. taxi ride away from nightlife in delhi is an excellent stopover if visiting Delhi. good pool and excellent food.
3,this hotel would qualify as a high end 3 star hotel. it's an older resort style hotel but has few amenities. the grounds are manicured and well kept and the pool was clean. if you are just looking for descent cardio equipment it should get the job done. The breakfast served was minimal but all you can eat. Overall our stay was pleasant and would consider staying again.
4,"this is one of the nicer hotels in Delhi and is conveniently located near both the domestic and international airport. hotel charges astronomical rates for its taxi service, so this certainly wouldn't suit the budget traveller."
5,"we stayed on our first and last nights in india, it was our airport hotel. the restaurant was quite convenient, when the buffet is on, that's what you have to have - otherwise you choose from a menu. we also enjoyed the breakfast, with plenty of choice available, and the gift shop was small but pleasant (although they did try to sell us an elephant with its tusks missing)."
6,"food,services room ambience everthing was really great. Not very close to town but good place to stay. good location to visit."
7,"the hotel is overpriced and its directorial policy - greedy. the rates changed when we were there, but they still charged us for the higher rate quoted in our e-mails."
8,"we (husband, wife and teenage daughter) stayed at the Ashok Country Resort for one night only. Probably the poorest value for money place we spent in during our two week holiday in Rajasthan, Agra and Delhi. given the relatively high rates, I'd rate the resort as below average at best."
9,the Ashok is a transit hotel used by holiday companies to accommodate travellers for one or two nights on their way in and out of india. the first floor rooms in the hotel are rather dark and dismal and in need of some refurbishment.
10,"the homepage of the Ashok Country Resort promises more than the hotel can provide. the garden is very nice, but it isn't calm because of traffic outside. it looks so nice from outside and in the lobby. but the room was not very clean and the beds were clammy. i was really disappointed."
11,the hotel seemed adequate for our hectic schedule as there was very little leisure time. grounds and pool seem nice but didn't have the time to explore that much. the food was reasonable for both dinner and breakfast.
12,i was supposed to stay for 4 nights but ran after 3 couldn't take it anymore. the worst rooms he has ever stayed in are motels with better service and rooms.
13,"we were arriving late from Bangkok with my girlfriend and on our way to Agra, so we thought we'll stay near by the airports. we had to look for the hotel driver in the line of all the other hotels driver at the exit gate for 30 minutes before the guy showed up, then it complained to us about the delay in addition of being plain rude...the room was horrible, look 20 years old, not even a proper mattress on the bed, the beds and towels were 10 years older...we ordered some room service at 0"
14,"great hotel, close to Delhi international airport, is ideal for a 1 night stay before an early flight. the main restaurant opened at 7pm, but it is not for light meals."
15,we found this Hotel good as part of the tour but for independant travellers would probably be too far out of town. evening meal was ok for one or two nights and breakfast was very good.
16,"we booked our stay for only one night in this hotel. we reserved a pick up service and upon arrival at the airport, we didn't see any one so the driver was upset and complaint and try to have an argument with us."
17,this hotel was a very welcome rest away from the hustle and bustle prior to leaving Delhi. the well manicured gardens and the relaxed bar and restaurant were just what we needed.
18,we arrived at this hotel on a kuoni golden triangle tour. if you drink wine the price is astronomical.staff friendly but they tried to charge us for our transfer to the airport which was sorted through kuni!!!!but you expect these tryu ons in india.food was good.i loved the omletts at breakfast.the rooms were very well decorated. overall this is an amazing hotel with truly lovely gardens and the lovelly swimming pool.
19,we booked this hotel as it was near the airport and was supposedly a very high standard. the manager greeted us an said 'any problems come and see me&quot; and charged the full amount of our stay on our credit card - very suspicious. there was no hot water in the room asked at reception and asked to wait an it would be fixed. an hour later the water was cold. I eventually lost my temper and called another hotel (the Raddison to stay there).
20,the hotel is on the outskirts of Delhi and is a great escape from the city. the pool was nice and the grounds were really well kept. we were generally pleased with this hotel.
21,the hotel was conveniently situated for the airport but a longish taxi ride from downtown Dehli. the pool was pleasant and the staff were fine.
22,"the hotel was conveniently situated for the airport but a longish taxi ride from downtown Dehli. the rooms were pleasantly decorated, clean and comfortable. The pool was lovely and very nice to sit beside with an cold beer. we phoned for radio cab to take us to the Sound and Light at the Red Fort (well worth seeing)"
23,a transit hotel in the suburbs can be hired for 1/2 day/night. the hotel is located right next to the busy road - 10 mins from the airport.Must request an 'quiet' room as this hotel's location is not bad for the locals and their need to blast their horn at every living thing they pass regardless of the time of night!
24,this hotel is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. I had booked the room several months prior to the stay and had email confirmation of the exact cost. the bathroom had a strong smell of urine and the air conditioner made the smell even worse.
25,the pollution in the area near the hotel/airport is horrendous and it seems a losing battle at this hotel. the air quality really bothered me here and not elsewhere.the room was the bare essentials. it reminded me of Eastern Europe inthe 80s and the gift shop was not enticing. The hotel is not easily accessible to sights.
26,the owner of the hotel was in attendance and keen to speak to all the guests and made sure everything was up to standard. it had a lovely pool area and nice restaurant (it was upstairs and no lift but that was the only problem for one of our party who is less mobile)
27,"the staff put heaters in the rooms, the bathroom was a little old but clean all the same. the only problem was that they only put the hot water on at certain times of the day so its either cold or tepid showers overall."
28,"the hotel chosen, I suspect, because of its proximity to the airport. when we arrived, Delhi was very smoggy, but that atmosphere pervaded it. i couldn't help worrying about the athletes coming here for the Commonwealth Games, hope they clean up their air quality before then!"
29,"the hotel taxi was parked 10 minutes walk away and with paying the carpark it took 40 minutes before we arrived. my flight was delayed, ended up staying for 3 hours.a good advise for whn you tay shortly, ask or you can nagociate the price."
30,"we arrived around ten in the evening and they had the correct rooms (twin beds, non-smoking) ready. they let us have tea and toast before we left which was nice of them. we used the half day rate that day and it was great to come back from the long trip to Agra and shower and change before our flight to the us."
31,on a recent trip to india we stayed at the Ashok Country Resort for our final night before flying home to the uk. the hotel was by far the worst place to stay in and the service from the reception was nothing short of rude and prices for drinks and food were 5 star hotel prices. Earlier in our trip in Delhi we were able to hire an air conditioned taxi for the price this hotel charged for an airport transfer.
32,we used the Ashok for a first night in india and were very satisfied. the hotel was comfortable and clean and the pool was good - we got over any jet lag. it seems to be good value for Delhi.
33,"the hotel provides a well signed, adequate and reliable transfer for IGI Airport to hotel, transfer time 15 mins. the rooms are big, clean and fairly comfortable. Feeding arrangements are good, but beware hordes of French groups on tour, and Kazak aircrews on layover."
34,"privately owned and operated, this full service hotel is located between city and airport and caters to Indian businessmen and European tour groups. Upon arrival one can not help but be impressed by the beautiful marble floor and stair case of the two story lobby with its massive crystal chandelier. the owner's son sits on a desk in the lobby and is very accommodating, as is the staff."
35,"hotel rates go in delhi, we paid £75.00 per room per night, and that included b/fast and airport pickup and drop. hotel is in a quiet location near the airport,rooms are big and comfortable,staff are polite and nvery helpful,food is not bad either."
36,we stayed here two nights in late march 2007. the hotel is fenced off and so it feels insulated from the hubbub and traffic. they let us take the salwar tops back to our room to try them on. bottled water to take with us on our next leg (8-hour drive to Nainital)
37,"the Reception staff were aloof and not very welcoming esp. as we were there on the first night of our tour. the room was fine with clean crisp bedding and a descent size, though the view was of 'a wall &amp; the window didn't quiet fit the frame'"
38,"stayed here on 1st and 7th day of the Kuoni Taj Tour. it's mainly clean, everything worked in the bedroom, although we had a very noisy fridge."
39,"when we arrived in Dehli we went straight to the hotel. the room was cold and the bed damp, we had to request an additional heater in our room! breakfast the following morning was okay. staff were helpful and polite. this is an average tourist hotel. good value for money."
40,"staff were pleasant and helpful, but they were booked solid. the rooms were clean and quiet, bathroom clean, adequate and good varied buffet breakfast. nice gardens, and the pool looked nice, though it was too cool to try it in December."
41,"we decided to stay in the Ashok after checking lots of reviews. the dew-smell smell outside was damp, but the rooms cannot be opened and are only airconditioned, and the smell was outside damp. there was a huge cloud over Delhi and no fresh air outside the garden. The people at the reception very polite and gave us our call to the airline free."
42,we stayed at the Ashok Country Resort for the first and last night of our Golden Triangle tour and again for a final night after our extention to Shimla. the room was OK the second stay was not so nice but had better view over the garden. it also had information about the Beauty Shop..we walked to the local village.... took 20 minutes not 5 as reception told us...BIG mistake.
43,"this was the most disappointing hotel we stayed in in India. the room was not cleaned properly, smelt a bit damp, no information in room about hotel facilities, poor outlook onto courtyard and no hairdryer in the rooms. only redeeming features were friendly staff, nice grounds and near the airport, suggest try elsewhere."
44,"room was lovely, with a large screen plasma! very clean. far too expensive for what it was (I paid £76) the grounds are very nice but the buffet restuarant is terrible. good for the airport and the atmosphere feels very relaxed - the chicken I had was hardly cooked and they didn't really seem to care."
45,the hotel staff were all very friendly and they even agreed to hold one of our bags for us while we did our golden triangle tour. the only downside is the distance to the city - it is about 45-60 minutes and costs about $25 by taxi. it may not be the best place to stay for your entire journey if you plan to go in and out of Dehli everyday.
46,"the hotel is comfortable near the both airports, nice when you arrive in the middle of the night and need sleep. the rooms have a good size; on the bathrooms you see the complex is older, but we have no complaints about it."
47,"stayed here for one night only as it's convenient fot the airport and we were flying home next day. helpful staff, comfortable room and good food."
48,a transit airport hotel would lower the room price by about one third. they also tried to overcharge us for the rooms until we showed them their email including the price.
49,"stayed here twice for one night in different rooms during a tour with Kuoni. overall the hotel is quite acceptable for short stay, and it's only approx 20 minutes from the airport. the rooms were fairly well appointed, the AC worked well, though the beds were very firm (we later found out that this is normal in Indian hotels)."
50,the gym is ok but opens late at 8am only. the hotel was close to the airport and price point is good. however the level of services is not up to mark. there is no in room internet access.
51,"the surcharge on long distance calls as charged by them could not be justified on any account. disappointing, to say the least. i was disappointed with what I got. the food was tasteless, the refrigerator in the room not working, room service willing, but incapable due to lack of experience."
52,"this is one of the worst hotels we stayed at during our time in India. the check-in and restaurant staff were rude, the restaurant was very poor and the carpets were stained - the price was expensive compared to other hotels. value for money was also poor since it was not even cheap. for a Gov. run hotel, it needs to get its act together."
53,"the hotel is owned by GOI, and so they get preferential rates. it was of the caliber of a nice Marriott -- clean, spacious (I'd stayed at the Taj Palace in Delhi 10 days earlier -- that was about as glitzy luxurious as I've ever been) service was professional but not obsequious, not overly solicitous."
54,"the state of the hotel is miserable, the only thing that has been restored is the entrance lobby. there is a problem with staff and front desk staff in particular - they are not interested at all to give any service to their guests. their only interest seems to be to get tipped! next time I definitively will look for another place to stay in Delhi."
55,I stayed in Ashok for 2 nights during a conference. the hotel has been booked by the organisers of the conference so I had no choice.
56,the location is quite good almost midway between the city center and the airport. the food was average and we preferred eating outside in the private restaurants situated within the building.
57,"great expansive property in one of the best areas in delhi. the hotel is trying to modernize post privaitization and addition of Fbar and the host of events it hosts is propelling it forward.Price is normally around 8k INR which makes it the cheapest in Delhi.Always full of foreigners, Indian bureaucrats and Indian airlines crew, this is a nice value for money hotel."
58,"jet Airways provided us one night stay at this hotel. hotel was given by airline - but we didn't find hotel equal to 5 star hotel standards.Rooms were smelly,A/C was not effective,No Courtesy by staff,Breakfast was cold,Dinner wasn not good in taste."
59,"as an invited participant of an' international Stakeholders' consultation,I was accommodated in 'The Ashok',Chanakyapuri,New Delhi. aristocratic name in the diplomatic enclave of the capital city raised our expectations to perhaps somewhat unreasonable limits."
60,ashoka hotel is one of the grandest hotels built by the govrnment. the hotel has exceptional facilties - the gym and swimming pool is very good.
61,"this is a very lousy place with nothing great about it and comes with very high tariff rates. everything is very costly and rooms are not well maintained, the only exception is the its Restaurant Frontier which serves good food."
62,"i stayed at the Ashok this past week and was relieved that it was not as horrible as the other reviews indicate. my room did not seem dirty, and housekeeping came daily, so maybe that helped. roaches are hard to eradicate in that part of the world. it is a third world country, after all...i think the problem is that they are charging first world prices."
63,"the staff were poor, the views awful and generally just disappointing. our deluxe room had a comfortable bed and that was about it. the six restaurants in the hotel only two were open and one was just vile.the other was average but top prices.Our 3 1/2 night stay cost £700 - do not stay here."
64,"the reception's staff was informed that the rate is the same. the staff at business-center tried to be of help and while services are really expensive, none of the 11 mails I had send arrived arrived... trying..."
65,"we wanted to spend time in some good hotel so we could remember the stay as well as the places of stay. we had heard a lot about Hotel Ashok, how magnificient it is and how marvelous the view from the hotel top looks."
66,"the Ashok is a government owned hotel and does not have the massive private investment of the other in the diplomatic enclave. I was greeted by staff who were friendly and helpful throughout my stay, and the decor is good, the place is clean and clean. everywhere I go I am saluted or bowed to. the decorations are good enough, nothing special and Paprika Chicken is awful, don't try the chinese restaurant, we ordered 3 plates of food and some rice and each dish"
67,my husband and I went there for a medical convention. the next morning we went to the hotel room late...Surprise! room was smelled up with tobacco! thanks heaven we brought our rubber slippers! you can't walk inside without it!
68,"hotel staff were a little creepy. our hallway smelled very bad (especially in the mornings) luckily, most of the smell remained in our room and didn't come into the room - it was just better in comparison."
69,"the staff was the rudest I've encountered anywhere, the room was dirty and the location was far from anything, and it was of course overpriced. I highly recommend against staying here."
70,the windows didn't fit properly so you had the noise and the smell of the traffic. we would have booked into a B&amp;B in the bazaar if we had wished to experience such an establishment in my life.
71,the Ashoka Hotel is one of the most reasonably priced 5-star accommodation available as it is still government owned. the acommodation is good and the service even better. will definitely use this hotel again.
72,"i found that my hair dryer would not work, my television, not the desk light, and some electrical sockets. when my message light showed, I discovered that the message key didn't work - the first person I asked to help me on this never came back to me in the room on it. the food (which tasted quite good, or at least the indian style food) was very expensive, but we waited 15/20 mins for some water to be brought to us, the use of wireless access cost $25 a"
73,"the hotel staff gave me the key to someone else's room and then acted like I'd done something sneaky to get it. if you haven't already grown sick of hearing &quot;madam, take a glance, no need to buy, just look, and get your fill on your way to the elevators."
74,"Hayes &amp; Jarvis 'upgraded' us to the Ashok from the Oberoi Maidens for the first 3 nights of our India tour. we read the reviews and hoped it would not be as bad as reported, but unfortunately it was. our rooms were dirty, especially the bathrooms which looked as thougth they had not been cleaned properly for years."
75,"the Ashok at USD400 a night for an ordinary hotel room, ordinary tired property with ordinary to below average service. the room is clean, the bed comfortable and the water hot but for USD 400 you want 'a little bang for your buck'"
76,"overrpiced - London prices for poor quality rooms and miserable service. the lowest point was when waiter in the lobby lounge wiped the tea cups with his finger, and later washed our cups behind the desk with water from a mineral water bottle, from which he was also drinking."
77,the hotel issued the same room to another guest after midnight. the room is qutie recently renovated and the bathroom has no bathtub so the floor is wet after shower. there is not enough space to place toiletries too. I could hear TV noises from other rooms and staff can be loud when they go around their duties along the corridor.
78,"the hotel has a good potential and facilities are worth five stars. for me, it was the last time that I stayed there. if the management can cope with the housekeeping issues it will certainly get better ratings."
79,my husband and we stayed at the Ashok Hotel last weekend. the receptionist upgraded us to the executive floor at regular rates - the room was clean with a view of the pool and plasma tv.
80,we had a terrible shock at the Ashoka Hotel. when we arrived in our room the porter followed us in the room withouth an invite we were shocked! they refused to take credit card payments and would only accept cash!
81,"stayed at the hotel Ashok, 50B Chanakyapuri, as part of a group tour in Delhi. it is in new Delhi south of the government area, with no neighborhoodto walk to, and no nearby subway. we found the service to be fine, but it definitely does not deserve its apparent 5 stars or justify the price(apparently $200+)."
82,"the service is about as bad as it gets. hotel restaurants are pretty poor as well - I had to send back under cooked chicken, and the fish got its revenge during the night :-(Was probably a great hotel 30 years ago but now rooms are shabby and run down."
83,"two nights at the hotel and the first night was terrible. the telephone looked like it hadn't been wiped down in 25 years, seriously no joke. I demanded a room switch so the second night I stayed in the newly renovated ones (the older, crappier ones will be renovated on soon)"
84,"an average 3 star hotel trying to be 5 star. the public areas are ok but the rooms are old, tired and dated. but others were paying $200 a night - sheer robbery."
85,"this was the worst supposedly 5* hotel we have ever stayed in. the staff were extremely rude, food was awful and the rooms were old and grubby."
86,"the hotel is ok if you pay not more than 80 EUR a night for the room. staff were friendly, room service quick, and the adjunct restaurants seemed to be alright, but everything there is just 'alright'"
87,hotel rooms were stinky. it was worst hotel I ever stayed in. I paid 180 $ (INR 8000) for 1 Night.Hotel reception was ok but Rooms are dead.I needed a hotel near US embassy so I unluckily chose this one.
88,"this hotel classifies itself as a 5 star DELUXE hotel and it probably was, 50 years ago. the exterior looks charming because of the architecture, very colonial but Indian at the same time. however, the inside is quite strange."
89,"the hotel is ridiculously noisy and stinks of must and exterminator's chemicals. the service ranged from indifferent to rude, except for the coffee shop staff and a smattering of housekeepers, it was simply outrageous. it has some great restaurants, an excellent spa, and bags of potential. but the government has got to stop pretending this is an five-star hotel."
90,"the government run hotel could be a splendid example of traditional Indian grandeur, its website claims. despite the lack of rooms in the city, I was forced to stay at The Ashok for my last business trip."
91,"the rooms are old and run down and staff are generally not very helpful. the only good things are the staff in the restaurant and the breakfast buffet. if you are staying in india, spend a bit more money and stay somewhere else."
92,"the Ashok is a tired, grimy, grubby hotel. the rooms are dirty and dated, the service is surly and unatentive."
93,"I originally was excited to be able to stay here after so many years. between the lousy food, the crappy rooms and the creepy guys (security &amp; maids) in the hallways - this is one hotel to avoid."
94,"we found grey towels and bed linen at 5* hotel. all over the hotel were signs of government ownership - too much of staff, equipment out of order, etc. I expect for that price you can get much better deal."
95,I was staying at the Ashok hotel between the 11th and 16th of may 2006 for business reasons. During my stay I found the rooms to be unclean and unsafe! whilst moving the hairdryer I received an electric shock. I reported this to the duty manager and asked to speak with the general manager.
96,"the balcony was very dirty, paint peeling off wood work and no balcony furniture. the windows were cracked, putty coming away and dangerous to open.the staff were rude, dismissive and unhelpful."
97,"Location: In Between Airport, Sites and Central CityService: Above Average Price: High for location, but worth the ratingRoom: Within the rated rating. within the ratings, location: in between airport, sites and central cityservice: above average price: below average value: 0 compared to the average location location. a good location - close to location and close close proximity to airports, site & central City."
98,"hotel Ashok is a big hotel in the diplomatic district of new delhi. it has many restaurants and shops and the lobby is Ok, but the hotel was nothing near being five star. &quot;Cleanliness' had no definition in that hotel : my bed sheet was dirty and stained, the minibar refrigirator didn't work and it was empty. the toilette mirror was rusty."
99,we spent our afternoon trying to get cleaner rooms rather than sight seeing. we finally got some rooms that were a little cleaner than the ones we first saw and ended up staying at the Ashok for one night in february. the management was neither friendly nor helpful. try to avoid staying here at all cost.
100,"we stayed in a suite on floor 5, this was well sized and we had 2 single beds put in the spacious living room. the room was good (uk 4 star std) the bathroom was not as good but adequate and the hotel overall is quite dated but in Delhi is probably quite modern."
101,stay at hotels such as Oberoi which are in a similar price range but deliver first-class amenities and services on all fronts.
102,the scale is so big that if the hotel is not full it is almost depressing eating in a 300 person restaurant. the new bar Steel is the best option this place had it was freshly done with good staff that tried and an excellent relaxed scene. It was the only real haven there where I did not dislike my stay.
103,receptionists personel asked my wife how long we are going to stay like they were afraid that we dont have enough money to pay. the restaurants had a good service except the chinese restaurant which they warm the food for 2nd time before the serve it.
104,"the staff were very grumpy looking and mean and behaved more like they did not really want to be there. the only saving grace was the performance of the musicians in the restaurant, Needless to say. i left the next day for another hotel."
105,"external appearance is great. the employees dress like professionals. but service is really poor. I stayed in one room. there was heavy construction noise very nearby. also there were block in bathroom sewage. Reported the trouble. they changed me to another room, but again not so good bath room and toilet (for the amount they charge)."
106,"the location of this hotel sucks, the area is unlit at night...desserted...so for a first time traveller it made me uneasy...it was basically in the middle developing hotels...construction surrounds it...I think they are trying to build an community of resorts. the room was small but nice, modern. we ordered room service, it wasnt bad."
107,"we were told we would be staying in a four star hotel in Old Delhi. however it transpired that we instead were booked into this hotel which is 25k from Delhi in another town altogether, Faridabad, an unattractive industrial area. the room was the worst we stayed in throughout our two week stay in India."
108,"the atrium hotel was active almost around the clock at the time. the service ranged from being, in the best case, just very awkward, to being extremely intrusive. in general it was always bad."
109,"we stayed at the Atrium for three nights in April. all staff were helpful and friendly. the entrance is grand, the communal areas are well decorated, and the rooms are comfortable. power can be erratic at times, but this is to be expected in Delhi.you will need transport if staying at this hotel, as it is a little out of town."
110,the avalon comes out of nowhere. the hotel is ideally located in the area it is situated in and you are thinking the worst!
111,the approach road to Avalon appears unfriendly and dilapidated. inside the courtyard the rooms are trendy and have a mini kitchenette - the long french windows lead into nothing... err!
112,the Avalon was a pleasure to walk into - bright and spacious reception with modern decor. very clean and pleasant check in procedure. staff were friendly and attentive when required.Downside is the location.
113,if you travel outside of this hotel you may need to pay a tax to get entry back into the district (your taxi will not pay this fee) it is also far from the sights and city center so be prepared to spend around 700Rs for 40m or 4 hours. we probably wouldn't go back because of location and proximity to anything in Dehli worth seeing.
114,"I stayed in one of the Residence suits which was lovely. the staff were delightful, really friendly and helpful.the spa was very nice and all facilities were included in the room priceInternet was super fast but expensive at 500RS for 2 hoursBreakfast was also delicious. it took just 30 minutes to get from the hotel to the airport for my homebound flight so it was really convenient as an overnight stop."
115,the residence room is nice as it's similar to service apartment. the staffs are ok but not really communicate among themself first. i was plan to go to lotus temple and reception guy call to chek that it is open on that day but when we went their it was close.
116,Sutese were very nice. Very modern and well equipped. Terrible view from window of high canvas fence installed. the restaurant was unlicenced and there was no bar in the hotel.
117,"this is a very nice, clean well serviced hotel. the gym is great, on staff massages available, and the internet is really good, although expensive.a great find."
118,"we travelled along rutted filthy streets in the rain so our first impression of India was not so good. the driver pulled into a lane way and said here we are, we couldn't see an hotel!"
119,"breakfast was served early for us as we were on an early train to Agra. a clean, modern and reasonably quiet breakfast stayed well."
120,"my girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night at the end of our recent holiday. the hotel is ultra modern and totally lacking in any of the character and charm we experienced during our stay at all the other wonderful heritage hotels and palaces throughout our trip. when you enter it, you feel like you are walking onto the set of some science fiction movie."
121,"new property had just opened this month. rooms are spacious and well suited for a medium term stay. Microwave, couch and small frig in each room."
122,"this hotel was away from the centre of Delhi so make time to travel in and out. rooms are spacious, modern. service was prompt and the food was good.Pool area is a bit run down and not very well attended."
123,"we stayed at the Claremont hotel because we were looking for a reasonably priced, clean comfortable hotel near the Delhi airport. distance-wise, the hotel is not that far, however it took us 40 minutes to drive to the airport at 7:15am on Monday morning, so we had planned for at least that amount of time. our room had 1 King and 1 twin bed that was brought in so it really only slept 3 comfortably."
124,Hall &amp; Poolside Lawn are perfectly maintain for private function. good stay and dining arrangement with family for couple of days.
125,hotel is made with class &amp; surrounded with greenary area. staff was Courteous and well groomed. I really recommend this Hotel.
126,specialy indian &amp; pasta's ; open pool with huge lawn for exercise or move around. over all nice hotel for stay with friend and famliy.
127,"cox and Kings travel agency used it as an 'airport hotel&quot; although it's 25 minute drive from the airport. the rooms are clean and decent, but the water was only lukewarm when I took a shower at 3:00am."
128,castle and King TourServices booked into the property on the tail end of an otherwise wonderful trip to Rajastan India. we encounted a non flushing toilet and had to use the lobby facilities all evening. noassistance to repair was available.
129,"pakage was great as the hotel was, we were on triple occupancy. we enjoyed the weekend with all recreational stuff &amp; evening with great wine..........food is equaly good but expensive enough......andamp clams to be 4star, its fair enough to  be...............and it's a 4 star hotel with 4 stars - it is the best hotel in the world!...we have stayed this holiday holiday on weekend!! i'm happy to stay here again again "
130,the rooms are very spacious and well maintained. the hotel restaurant is very good and serves Indian and continental food. a good place for business meeting and conferences.
131,"the conference hall was huge and the staff was cooperative. they did make all arrangements as per our requirements. the food is ok, not great. Overall good for business travellers and tourists travelling alone or couples. May not be attractive or value for money for families."
132,"the reception staff at check-in was probably a trainee from one of the hotel management institutes - had absolutely no clue about my reservation. the room was spacious, and relatively clean, with the TV being an old piece of junk that made strange crackling and hissing noises. luckily, I had no opportunity to sample the food, except for breakfast on the first morning."
133,the staff stood me out while they went to the room and checked the minibar status how much to charge me while I was in a hurry to get to airport.
134,i stayed in qutab hotel in march for a day. it's purely not business class hotel.building is old and very average in terms of rooms and services.cleanlyness is ok but not very good.moreover the surroundings makes it worse.there is an garbage dump near by.no gud market near par.bad locality.i would merely not recommend it.
135,"this is not a 5 star hotel by any standard. there are true luxury hotels in Delhi. the hotel is in the middle of nowhere surrounded by nothing. it's old and tired, and so are the rooms."
136,this hotel claims to provide a 5 star service and facilities but falls very far short in terms of delivery. staffing attitude - patina of obsequiousness displayed by staff was not matched by the concept of service provision to the customer 'obstructive and just plain unintelligent'
137,"rooms are spacious, some with great flatscreen tv, others with standard equipment. good beds, minibar, in room safe, okay bathroom (not much water pressure in shower). swimming pool looked good (but too cold to try, outdoor)"
138,"we stayed here for one night at the start of our tour &amp; for 2 nights. the rooms were very clean, modern, quiet and comfortable."
139,"stayed at the Qutab twice for a total of six nights in June 2007. internet worked fine, and 2.5 Euros per hour is not an unusual charge. you don't want to walk around in the neighborhood, except maybe into the park just next to the hotel."
140,"the hotel was rated and regarded as one of Delhi's Delux hotels. it is not located in the downtown core of the city, but set admist absolute squalor. the property caters to mostly Indian business people and is definately not for a tourist visiting Delhi. not recommended."
141,"hotel staff in Delhi will tell you what you want to hear about their star rating. I paid $140 per night for my stay, but demand is greater than supply for hotels, so they charge you whatever they can think of. if there are no rooms available, they are not going to bother to let you know in advance."
142,we stayed at the Quatab for 14 days last year and the service was exeptional. we are trying to book again for 2006 and are looking for a new book for 2006.
143,"my family and I stayed at the Qutab on 2 separate occasions in january 2005. on leaving we did not have time to go to the post office and post our holiday postcards - about 20 of them. So we left the money for postage with staff in the reception and someone promised to post the cards.Now, 3 months later, nobody has received a postcard."
144,Conclave Comfort is one of the 3 hotels by the same group in the surrounding locality. ideally situated specially for people travelling towards Okhala.
145,"the phone on the floor rings very loudly every time the hotel gets a call - annoying, it's impossible to sleep. the room is smelly, warm water tap doesn't work and is very dirty. breakfast room in Delhi is ridiculous, dishes not clean and so on!"
146,"we were booked to stay a couple of nights and we only stayed one. the heater was on but it got lost in translation along the way from heater to shower head. we are told an engineer is on his way up and assures us there will be hot water. at this point, we have now lost about 2 hours or more from our day."
147,corus is supposed to provide a 3 star experience to. the frugal sorts whose budget is below 4K this seems to be the best place available. if you increase your budget to 5K you choices are limited. staff is extremely courteous/professional and helpful.3. Cafe coffee day at the entrance and the general location is excellent as far as connectivity is concerned.
148,"I stayed in the hotel for two nights &amp; enjoyed my stay. The hotel is very centrally located, and the room had a wonderful view. I could see entire Connaught Place."
149,"corus was the most expensive hotel we stayed at in India. the location was great, right on the center ring of Connaught Place in between Old and New Delhi. there's a great coffee shop in the front (with REAL coffee, hard to find in india)."
150,"we had three rooms for our group, two of which were dumps. one room on the top floor at the front of the building had access to a superb terrace with stunning view of Connaught Place. others have complained about all kinds of aspects, and they're true. it's kinda dirty, the breakfast was terrible and the rooms are horrid without the terrace."
151,"stayed with family for three nights at the beginning of a 3 week holiday. the tiny rooms could have been cleaner, dirty windows gave us our first look outside. staff was friendly and helpful. fortunately most of the other hotels were of higher quality than the Corus."
152,"&quot;hotel's location was one of the worst I have ever stayed in. very noisy, rooms offexternal corridor backing onto dirty back streets.very basic amenities,worn sheets, bug-tablets, no hot water.No lift, had to lug bags upstairs."
153,"myself and 3 colleagues stayed at the Corus in the end of November for a week. the hotel was booked by our Indian colleagues and it was reasonable - and much better than I had anticipated. main problems were:- No hot water for showers- My room was the only room with window- the shower flooded the bathroom when you used it- at night it wasn't noisy outside and my colleague had boiler above his room which made noise constantly- The room serivce was terrible, microwaved, luke warm"
154,we arrived to our room around 11 pm and requested an 8 am wake-up call. either they misunderstood us or we were woken at 3 am. we got dressed and then looked at our watch so we ended up drinking tea in the room until breakfast. breakfast was outside in a patio area and was done very nice. they didn't put out an abundance of food so the hotel must have not been full but it was tasty.
155,"the first room we were shown had no windows but they moved us to one at the back with a window off an external corridor. there were bugs that came up through the shower drain, but perhaps this is just an feature of New Delhi - the reception staff seemed either exceptionally helpful or surly, no in between."
156,a friend booked this hotel on tripadvisor and checked out the hotel. the pictures made it look much more promising than it really was.
157,"there is the door bell man INSIDE THE ROOM STEALING FROM THE BAGS. the manager from the hotel asked me not to call the police, and try to 'digest it'"
158,the best part of the hotel is its location - the inner circle of Connaught Pl. you are right in the heart of Delhi and next to the subway/metro.
159,"first time we stayed we had a standard room, which could also be called world's smallest room. the bathroom, barely room to turn around, was fairly clean but we didn't sleep well at all as we were right by the stairs so it was really noisy. i found the smell really overpowering. they have little white balls in the sink (accord to my husband you get these in urinals)"
160,"hotels in new Delhi are notoriously overpriced, and after four nights we stumbled across the Corus Hotel in Connaught Place. we immediately booked a room for our return five weeks later. the price was Rs 5000...about US$135. The final graceful touch was after allowing us the free use of an available room in which to rest before our late night departure to the airport."
161,the hotel's location is very good - right in Connaught Place. the staff was friendly though the front desk was understaffed.
162,"we stayed at 6 hotels during our stay in india and all the rest were good to pure luxury, this hotel is really a 1.5*, i couldtn give it even 2 stars. the air con was extremely noisy so we switched it off, but the humidity in the room was awful as there was no air or natural light."
163,"if you are gonna be out of the hotel during the entire day, then there is no point to spend a lot of money to the other 5 star hotels which you need to pay between 300-500 USD per night. it's at the Inner Circle of Connaught Place, where you can find many international fast food restaurants, shopping places, post office, etc.."
164,"the hotel was totally over-priced for the quality of the experience. it cost 5000 rps, plus tax, for a double room for one night, and was based on the latest review in Lonely Planet. the staff were friendly, but unhelpful. when we had problems they couldn't fix them."
165,the reception area is nice &amp; was being refurbished when we arrived. my room was in the main block and had no windows. it was very quiet. air con fan worked really well. the only problem was getting hot water. there was never any. a cold shower suited me fine. I would recommend this hotel to others.
166,"hotels in Delhi are overcharged and we didn't want to spend so much. we booked directly with their webpage and also payed for airport pick up, since we arrived late at night. the hotel is ok, the bed is clean but the bathroom is awful! no hot water and found many big insects at the shower."
167,"great place, good service, excellent oriental cusine at the restaurant called Bonsai. overall a very comfortable stay. keep it up!"
168,"price: excellent $90Location: Excellent - CentralService: Hospitality Redefined. New hotel, Great ServiceRooms: Small, but Reasonable – Neat, Clean and comfortable.they should show more of their room pics than passage photos on their website's'"
169,"we stayed here for 3 nights after arriving in india for a 3 week tour. the room was large but with grubby sheets,tepid water and the special bonus of blood stained towels! the breakfast which comes to room is only white sliced toast although we noticed Indian guests having cooked food in the corridor as there is no dining room."
170,"their motto is &quot;Hospitality Redefined'' which, after reading this personal account, is quite apt but for all the wrong reasons. the exhorbitant fee of U$155 nightly plus 1212% Delhi hotel tax fee includes phone bills charged to your room, no toilet paper, only Pepsi in the room bar and no offstreet parking."
171,"they have started charging on the Wi-Fi use, 100 rupees per day. double room price at 900, and although the rooms are reasonably clean and quite nice, most are nothing like the photos on their web site."
172,"they have an elevator, free luggage storage, they offer airport pick up and drop off for a minimal fee. they also offer city tour by private taxi, so you won't have to ask for more."
173,cottage Yes Please has friendly and helpful staff and a nice guy that says 'Namaste' to you when you come and go out the front door. the only downside is that they no longer have free wifi -- it costs 100 rupees per day now.
174,"if you arrive at reception, you are asked to show your passport as they cannot wiat 15 minutes for you to get in the room, unload and refresh. then, they demand you pay in advance - even though you're out of local currency and you have stacks of dollars to display them 'if I have recovered from my journey'"
175,stayed here for 3 nights+ OK staff+ Good location for travelers+ Room service + Good rooms- no hot water in the room- driver we organized to the airport through them kept falling asleep at the wheel (not technically their fault) 3/5/5.
176,"the hotel is one street over from the main Bazaar road in an area called Pahar Ganj. it's teeming with activity and there are endless shops where you can get inexpensive handicrafts, clothes, colorful tapestries, henna body painting, etc."
177,"cottage Yes Please is on a side street off the main Pahar Ganj bazaar. it's the filthiest neighborhood I've ever stayed in, with mud and livestock in the streets. the hotel owns two pretty good restaurants across the street -- Malhotra and Dosa Please."
178,"a good hotel considering the price and location. good location in dingy pahar Ganj/Main bazaar, but really close to the metro station so you don' t really have to walk through the city if you want to."
179,it was our first night in Delhi and we decided to stay in the Pahar Ganj area. the a/c room was ok and clean but very hot before the noise woke us up at the airport around midnight.
180,"the hotel itself was reasonable and clean, especially in comparison to the majority of places in new delhi. the AC did not work for half of the time, and there was hot water for about 5 minutes in total. we were billed for 3 nights, when we had only spent two nights at hotel, on the spurious grounds that we arrived before 12 noon on our first day of our stay. after losing our tempers the manager reduced the fee to half a day, but in any case our last day in india was dampened by"
181,"room 406 is located at Phar Ganj, very convinience to go to Agra. the hotel is very clean, staffs are so nice. all kinds of facilities are available, ex, train booking, taxi, internet, money change. restaurant on roof top is started, when I was there, it was under construction."
182,"the rooms are ok, a reasonable size with some natural light. ours had fridge and tv, but there were stains down the walls which I'm sure could have been removed with good clean."
183,the greeting room/ entrance is fairly nice. the rooms are dirty and beds uncomfortable. Bathrooms old and dirty with no hot water - even when asked specifically if we wanted hot ice we didn't get any!Didnt eat breakfast there...didn’t dare.
184,"Rooms #409 &amp; #410 are the only renovated rooms in this hotel. Located on the same floor as the restaurant. Nice breakfast but horrible dinners. I wouldn't suggest ordering anything, walk around the corner and get a veggie burger at McDonalds and the Indian sweet shop - Bikanervala."
185,"the bus tour departs from the Crest Inn. it was the off season so it seemed relatively professional and structured for tourists. the driver was curt and didn't understand my questions and attempted to leave without me after breakfast. when we came to the first stop in agra, my bus was nowhere to be found. there are infinite transportation-for-hire options in India so I was able to make it home again using alternate transportation."
186,"the Crest Inn hotel is one of the cleanest places you will find in Delhi. it was the only place where bedsheets and towels did not need to be changed out the minute we entered the room. the hotel restaurant is not much for food, so be prepared to head out for all your meals."
187,the bathrooms have bath tubs which leak and toilets do not flush properly. breakfast is served in an untidy small room and is often not prepared preoperly. the staff were very pleasant however and tried to make our stay comfortable. please avoid this hotel.
188,the last day we came to settle the problem but they just told us that it was a mistake &amp; didn't want to pay us back. we were forced to look for an other hotel (first night in India...) in the late night... we found it thanks to the taxi driver.
189,"the hotel was booked by a travel agent and the 2 star rating was lower than we had talked about. we wanted to minimize our expenses, especially since we believed that we would also be using room service in the u.s."
190,"it's web site makes it sound like the Ritz! what a shock when I arrived. Reception staff not very friendly, workmen on the stairs painting and repairing the lift. the dining room was just as bad. Don't go near the place!"
191,"Travel agent said was one of the 'better' hotels in Karol Bagh! I would avoid and go to the hotel Swati down the road!Room: very noisy from street noise, plumbing etcShower: Poorly maintainedService: OKRestuarant: Dull, dimly light, ok food/menuBreakfast: Standard fayrefast. hotel was a good hotel!"
192,it was an excellent hotel and the food was also good. There were Swiming pool and spa facility were excellent. we got hair hair cut from Silvi. the room was awesome.
193,"good service, nice and clean.&quot;Too much attention sometimes from service staff.Nice with gym inside the hotel.nice."
194,the room service staff were rude and unhelpful on every occasion Buffet restaurant is just indian food and no variety.surrounding area verry dirty dirty. the rooms staff are friendly and eager to please but if you don't keep the privacy button on they knock in the hope of tips!
195,the Crowne Plaza Delhi is 5 Star Deluxe Hotel located in the heart of New Delhivery very good arragment. the hotel is a 5 star hotel.... the... the crownel is the best hotel in this..... the 5star Deluxe hotel was located at the top of the new Delhii......the best place to stay!
196,"cozy interiors make you comfortable in the rooms. all the necessary amenities are at available, great reastaurant and nice food makes everyone happy."
197,"the breakfast was so bad it defies description vegetarian omellete with bacon in it, uncooked eggs served as an amellette, hairs on the food. therooms were ok but small, but stay if you are desperate foor your room, otherwise avoid at all costs at any costs."
198,"the hotel is nice, the room is comforable and clean and serviced well. the reception staff were rude and unhelpful on every occasion I needed to speak wih them. if you don't keep the privacy button on they will knock frequently in hopes of tips!"
199,it was our first time in India and at a Crowne Plaza hotel. our room overlooked the pool and entrance to the hotel. on arrival everything during registration was completed while we were able to eat the cold drink. the room was quite large and there were always bottles of water on our return every day. The atrium bar is lovely and quiet but like everywhere in india expensive. we did not have the buffet although it looked very good.
200,"you can rent a driver and car and tour around Delhi, which is amazing. it was my birthday when we booked in and as you have to give your passport they saw the date and arrived up to my room with the birthday cake, present and flowers."
201,the word Hospitality should make sure that the staff &quot;Does not Humiliate and Insult'' its guests.Learn the Basics before even thinking of running a hotel.
202,"the service was way above standard for india, about average by Canadian standards. the rooms were the cleanest of anywhere we stayed in India - rare it seems in Delhi."
203,"the hotel was booked by local colleagues for its location to the office, and sort-of-good facilities. the staff are well-meaning and try hard, but are not polished, I'm sure. a better training would help as you can tell they are trying to please."
204,"they have customised services for japanese guests like TV channels and breakfast. food is not too great for the kind of money they charge, better to eat out in the shopping arcade outside the hotel. they also have services like tv channels, fft stts & a personalised service for their guests. cld have been better, they offer bespoke services to their customers."
205,"the staff at the Crowne Plaza Hotel New Delhi is outstanding. I had price issues with our first night stay. the hospital that booked us waited to long to get the lower price rooms. i was forced into the higher price and didn' t know until check out. we paid and went on to a hospital where I was admitted. one of the managers came to the hotel to speak with us. she made our trip! service slow in main restaurant and food not to our liking, the Japanese restaurant was awesome! the ja japan restaurant"
206,the property is large and well-appointed if not particularly attractive to look at fomr the exterior. the food is good and room service very efficient.
207,"i had an opportunity to visit new delhi recently and to stay at crowne plaza. check in was really easy, with cooperative staff. the room was very good and exactly as promised on the hotel website. in short, it was worth it."
208,"Surya has large and spacious rooms.the food is excellent. the front office staff is very efficient and not well groomed. location is good too, considering the size of delhi."
209,five star hotelgood for official partieslocated in posh south delhicentral location in southgood servicegood food. 5 star hotels in the south of the afl hotel - five stars hotel good for the official party parties. the hotel is located at the 5star hotel hotel in central location. st ls hotel with fas : 5 stars for hotels with five-star hotels..
210,"floor 3/ regular twin bed room!nice breakfast, great room service... bathroom fitted with latest amenities...defintely a recommend for any frequent travellers!"
211,the shopping arcade is reasonably priced and shopkeepers open to negotiation so one can get a steal. the chinese is absolutely delicious.
212,"the location is so-so, and the surrounding area less accomodating to intrepid guests than other parts of the city."
213,"Intercontinental is consistently superior on quality. Crowne Plaza was a tad more expensive (for which read extortionate; this is Delhi, after all) than the admirable nehru Place - but some way behind the quality. the walls appear to have been painted by the same five year old responsible for the grouting around the shower!"
214,"nice place, nice membership benefitsclean, all facilities, centraly located.nice bufffets and everything u think is above normal grade."
215,"the hotel did a very poor job of organizing the leisure package that I had selected. even after talking to the resident manager, they did not address the matter. Very poor service for what the charges are."
216,this hotel is a good choice for you to stay for two of days. just expect an excellent room and no other services including service.
217,new Delhi is not the greatest place to stay in what is the wonderful country of India. it's convenient for Aggra and as a brief stop-off before going to the north - but not really great destination in its own right. if you do happen do be in New Delhi (I was for 8-days on business April 2009) then I certainly recommend the Crowne Plaza.
218,"its an excellent hotel... Stayed there many a times on official visit... Excellent ambience, service, location. excellent location, excellent atmosphere and service."
219,"the electrician arrived early evening and when we switched on the lights some worked, some didn't, the TV and air con did not work. by now it was getting late to eat so we again thought, only one night we will leave the aircon off.night 3- we arrived 11.00 pm."
220,the hotel is extremely good. rooms are lavish and beautiful. I liked the hotels rooms the most.See the room photograph below. a room photo of the rooms is shown below.
221,the hotel gym is small and smelly and is crowded as everyone gets there at the same time after work and your better in doing an early morning workout before you start work.food is apalling and the choice of western food is disappointing.
222,"the shopping arcade &amp; food courts adjacent to the hotel is the best. a great location, warm welcome and great food. this hotel, perhaps is best in Delhi for business travellors. well connected to delhi and neihghbouring states UP, Haryana etc."
223,"Crown Plaza in Delhi is always a great pleasure to stay in. it has good restaurant, good rooms and good location. the hotel is located in the heart of the city centre and is just 5 minutes walk from the train station."
224,"the fare has risen in the last few months, but corporates do tend to get attractive discounts especially for long stays. the hotel is one of the best that I have come across in New Delhi. it has all the modern amenities that are required for a business hotel."
225,"the restaurant and bar were very nice, but really expensive. the breakfast buffet was really good, everything is geared towards Japanese and Western tourists. a good breakfast was excellent and the room was very comfortable."
226,"the recent Indian currency depreciation helped- so 9,000-10,000 rp now translates to just $200 vs. over $250 6 months ago. hotel management responded to my complaint- at the manager's reception I upgraded to club room with less noise.Certain issues:1. Short power outage, happens several times a day, even in the lobby- after terror attacks, I was kind of alerted.2. Avoid connecting room- noise from neighboring room is too loud- I heard the cough next"
227,the hotel is some distance from both the cultural centre of Delhi and the international airport (over half an hour in busy periods - from each) the surroinding area is quite filthy.
228,"hotel rooms in india are expensive but in this hotel you receive exactly what you need after a busy day in the city (clean rooms, bathroom, comfortable bed, international TV channels, internet, etc)"
229,food wise they have a 24 hour cafe/restaurant on the ground floor which serves Indian and Continental dishes. rustle up good plate of fries which are great sandwiched between some butter naan!
230,great hotel with good service overall. the rooms are well equipped but on the small side. tried out the 2 restaurants - the top Chinese restaurant was very good although quite pricey for India standards! staff generally very helpful. not much in the surrounding area except small shops and restaurants.
231,"the room was nicer, and at the end of the hall so maybe a little bigger. we only asked for one rollaway bed, which at first was separate mattress on the floor! they let us keep our extra luggage for free and kept an arriving parcel for us."
232,stay here at beginning and end of tour in India booked with Jetsave. reception area lovely and pool very nice with beds in shade. unfortunately several swimming lessons for local children held in the pool made it crowded and noisy at evening time when you wanted to use it. Room good with complimentary bottles of water and tea and coffee making facilities All our meals were paid but drinks pricy here.
233,"the hotel is located nearby shopping areas, banks, resturants local markets ect. it is fit for any kind of traveller,for business,tourist,or family vaccations, if you should travel to India in the future, will choose this hotel for my stay."
234,"the hotel is out of the way from the airport and main tourist areas. staff refused to accept that I was told it was complimentary, and demanded to pay it. i was with a co-worker, who also heard it is complimentary. now, I dont even really care about the money, work pays for it, but the principle of it bothers me."
235,"the main open areas are airy and bright, nicely fitted out and the bar area below reception lacks atmosphere it’s a good place to meet. breakfast buffet was very good, especially if you like Massala Dosa for breakfast like I do, there were omlettes and fruit."
236,"my business colleagues booked three nights for me in the Crowne Plaza during a recent business trip to our nearby India headquarters. the public spaces are spacious and flashy, and are intended to impress, mainly due to its convenient location near my colleagues' work location."
237,the hotel has a problem with the air conditioning: at restaurants and in the lobby it is very cold. it takes ages till you get served (tea arrives after the breakfast is done)
238,"we stayed here on the first night of kuoni taj tour. arrived early morning (7am) and they managed to get us in a room for half eight, which we weren't expecting. we went to the local shops to go to an ATM. it's obviously an expected part of india to encounter fairly stark poverty, but it was still an eye opener. staff were very friendly and hotel was very modern and clean."
239,"we stayed here twice during a recent tour of india. both times it was welcome place to stay in an hectic city.spacious lobby, spacious room,extremely clean and well kept.Staff was helpful, breakfast was good."
240,stayed at Crowne Plaza with group of 5 girls for whom this was part of India 'experience' girls arranged day trip to Taj Mahal with meals and guides.
241,"I have stayed in this hotel 3 times over the past 4 years, travelling on business; the last time was December 2006. I stay because of it's proximity to my business. the rooms are clean and spacious and really what you'd expect from a 4 star hotel."
242,"the service in the hotel was below average and at times was totally ignored by staff at hotel's reception. hotel lacks atmosphere and beware the rooms on the 1st floor, often the very rooms offered by some travel websites."
243,"the double bedroom was large enough to move without problems, big bed with excellent mattress, clean sheets, room equipped with desk+chair, sideboard, armchair with table, flat-screen tv."
244,"the pool was clean, with an impressive lobby but the room was smallish, had old decor, and had a shakey door that needed to be repaired. the post cards that i gave to the bell desk (with money) never arrived in Australia. would not return to this hotel."
245,"stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 6 weeks while on a business trip. hotel was clean and staff friendly. Overall an excellent hotel and will be even better once renovation works are all completed, unfortunately this did mean loud noise/banging sometimes but staff always helpful and apologetic."
246,"the hotel itself isn't as luxurious as the Taj Palace in Delhi in terms of service, food, and comfort, but its still pretty excellent. the location of this hotel is also excellent, it is within walking distance of some great resturants, both Indian and Non-Indian, Ego Thai which is nearby was great and some of the best thai food I have had from around the world."
247,I was upgraded to the Premiere Club floor but was unable to partake of the amenities and perks. the hotel policy is that upgrades to Club Floors are not welcome or able to use the club floor facilities. they gave me a very expensive auyervedic massage in the spa.
248,"the hotel is not closed to the center, but you can hire a 3 wheeled car for 100 rupeehs per hour (don't pay more!). transfer by local taxi to international airport takes about 45min."
249,the hotel was in my opinion excellent. the restaurants were good and breakfast was excellent. I stayed at this hotel as part of a tour.
250,"the hotel is located on the outskirts of the centre of Delhi, but as it is such a vast metropolis I would not make location an issue."
251,"we booked for 7 nights but could only handle 3- we managed to get in to the Hyatt hotel - new and clean. the hotel is near the middle of Delhi and the Crown Plaza is miles away for anythingBook the grand or the hyatto / the Grand, I wish we did from start."
252,"the hotel was OK, but quite far from the airport if you're just staying overnite as we were. when we arrived, they said they had 1 room for 2 people, and were sold out."
253,the reception was huge and dazzling.there were plenty of lifts available. the breakfast was buffet style and very good. they catered easily for my gluten free diet.the staff were courteous and friendly.
254,the staff at this hotel is outstanding. i had price issues with our first night stay. the hospital that booked us waited to long to get the lower price rooms. I was forced into the higher price and didn’t know until check out. my husband was furious. we paid and went on to a hospital where we was admitted. one of the managers came to the hotel to personally speak with us and clear up the issue. our room was lovely and the service was slow and food not to our liking. The Japanese restaurant was awesome!
255,"this hotel in Delhi is an upmarket property to stay with. we all were booked for two nights and our stay was an experience worth sharing about. our Check in was done with soft drinks and warm welcome by the Reception lady, room was on the renovated floor with paintings in the corridor reflecting Indian art(impressive)."
256,"my name is Wilson Garry stayed between 3rd Sep 06 and 07th Sep 06. I was highly worried about my trip to New Delhi. check in was prompt and welcoming, was given a room on the 2nd floor which was fresh and contemporary. Room had features like LCD screen TV, Cubicle bath,bedside console etc."
257,"the Crowne Plaza in New Delhi was probably a great hotel ten years ago. the hotel was under renovation, and supposedly, some floors are completed - but it is showing its age. i did not see those floors. The lobby needs help. my room needed help, but the electrical outlets were iffy, the fixtures were cracked, fading, or the marble surfaces were showing much of wear. I need to have an electrical outlet next to the bed for some medical equipment that I use when I sleep, so it's"
258,we arrived early on the morning after an overnight flight and were very pleased to be given a room at 7.30am. the room was newly refurbushed with flat screen TV and well equipped.
259,"stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 2 nights, had an excellent room on the 7th floor. it had been recently refurbished with modern amenities including a large plasma TV. the Chinese Restaurant was excellent (but not cheap), we used the executive lounge for breakfast and snacks and the food was very good."
260,"most of the rooms need refurbishing and the bar area has got to be the most inhospitable place in India! forget any intimate surroundings, this bar is in the atrium with 30 m high ceilings."
261,the hotel is located right next to the new Delhi railway station(NDLS) the metro station is again at a walking distance in fact closer than NDSL. the negatives i mentioned shouldn't be an deciding factor according to me given the security issues which the country faces.
262,"the hotel is very close to the new Delhi Rly station. there is a metro entry just out side the train station, and the metro is just outside the station. if compared Room rent vs Cleanlilness, it will rank-1 in India. for Train Traveller, even better."
263,"very warm and cozy rooms, plush interiors, nice service and tasty food. good connectivity for business and tour planner available in the hotel. excellent value for money."
264,"for $40 you get clean rooms with satelite TV, AC, wireless (must pay but only $5 for 24 hours) and clean bathrooms. we also stayed at a few 5 star hotels which were (as expected) better but then again cost us $300... found Ginger to be the best bargain around."
265,"the hotel's location is just yards from the unimaginable filth and detritus and all-round excremental disgrace that is the new Delhi Sewerage Station, I mean - New Delhi Railway Station."
266,we booked ginger Delhi for 2 days and left hotel with 2 hours of checking-in. hotel staff did not even check if room was clean before handing over the room - they cleaned it and only cleaned what we showed. after a second glance there were bunch of hairs on the other side of the bed that the cleaner royally ignored.the walls had shoe prints. but at least I expected housekeeping to clean those marks from the wall. the quilt was almost black from one side and had couple of yellow spots all over.
267,"taxi driver 'phoned' ginger hotel and was advised they'd over-booked. he apologised profusely and explained how the sister hotel was so much better than it was a scam, so we were immediately able to book in!"
268,"ginger hotels is a chain of hotels in India, mainly set up for business travellers. the Delhi hotel is right behind new delhi train station so centrally located for seeing the city."
269,"a good restaurant, business station and travel desk within the lodge are within walking distance. railway station is 5 min walk away, and is close to the san francisco airport."
270,"ginger new delhi can't be ur second choice... it was so calm, peaceful and clean that at time i felt to leave the place never. so cheap and nearby to the station it is an amazing place to live in in. it's a beautiful place for the u - if you want cleanliness, you're the best! 'it' was clean, so clean and so peaceful that when it wasn'' he stayed in it and was incredibly clean."
271,"this hotel has small rooms for 1 person which cost about half of a standard room, so perfect when traveling solo. if getting there by taxi, be sure to tell the driver it's by the Ajmeri Gate of the train station or they'll have hard time finding it - and book at least one week ahead of time. it books up, mostly by locals."
272,the restaurant is open 24hours with good food although the staff are very rude and unanattentive. downside is that there are no shops around the hotel and you need to get to them (Connaught Place 5mins) which are available just outside a hotel.
273,"this is an excellent choice and great value for the price. the room and bathroom were clean, A/C was great, flat screen TV with cable, hot water (though much better in morning than night), very cheap phone calls, internet in the lobby and very helpful staff. restaurant is ok. if you check their website, it will show it fully booked for months to come."
274,the ginger hotel was nothing great but it's only one stop by Metro (entrance very close to the hotel) to Connaught Circus where there are plenty eating places. Would definitely stay there.
275,"the hotel is basic but clean enough. Room has complimentary water (2 bottles a day), hot water pot, TV. there are 2 computers available in the lobby for Rs 110 for 1 hr. the staff was friendly and means to be helpful. one just has to give them time."
276,ginger booked our 3 night stay in new Delhi for 1000 rupees. the location is amazing - bang next to the railway station.
277,TATA have opened this hotel in the railway station complex and not inside/ near airport. the cost of the food is little higher which tATA need to relook at..
278,CP is the best place to dine.6. 24hrs restaurant7. Water dispenser on every floor8. Very courteous staff including room service staff.
279,real value for money hotel. an ac room at rs 999 is an excellent value-for money. san london hotel is the best value hotel in the utt - if it is worth it..
280,I was travelling to Delhi from Mumbai and this hotel came as a surprise choice after me completing the train ticket on irctc.co.inI was directed to www.railtourismindia.com.
281,"we were on the way to Kerala and stayed here in a twin room. we strongly recommend this hotel to all the visiting couples and families. one of the best thing is the easy access of railway station. you can even see your train standing at platform no. 10, 11 and 12 while having west side window opening rooms."
282,"this hotel is just steps from the new Delhi train station. it has clean rooms, comfortable beds and decent bathrooms at very reasonable prices. the area around the station does look a bit intimidating but I never felt in danger, even late at night."
283,"the rooms are clean, the staffs are very polite, No disturbance, Overall I would say you get an ambeince of a five star at the cost of 3 star hotel."
284,"great hotel with everything you need - mini fridge, flat panel TV. 4 beds in family room, free water bottles, separate shower,toilet,washbasin etc."
285,this hotel is good but is not ar per the desired standard. I have also visited the Bangalore Ginger hotel but this one is in Delhi not so good. also there is no room service at all. so this is also a problem.
286,"the 3-star Raunak Hotel is the best value for money. the service was good,the food was splendid and the staff were very helpful and understanding.I really enjoyed my stay there.."
287,"stayed here on 2 separate occasions during March and rate the hotel very highly. location is walking distance from new Delhi train station which is ideal if you want to catch a train at 6 in the morning. rooms are clean, modern looking, have good air conditioning system, flat screen TV's, good hot showers and comfortable beds."
288,"the ginger has all the atmosphere of a businessman's hotel, but the rooms are clean and neat and staff is responsive to requests for assistance."
289,ginger hotel (the erstwhile Rail Yatri Niwas) is very nice hotel. the room rates are also resonabel at around 1200 Rs.
290,"the hotel is a budget hotel, so don't expect any frills. you'll find omelette and toast, and you can get an auto-rickshaw for 5-10 minutes and go to Connaught Place to eat something. if you like Indian food you’re going to enjoy yourself."
291,"113 rupies per hour, wi-fi everywhere, pharmacy, corner shop and a tourist desk. ginger hotel everywhere we'll go in India!"
292,"the ginger is cheap, clean and comfortable. we tried a 4 bed family room and the 2 bed twins, both fine and have better bathrooms."
293,"hotel Ginger is a quality accomodation and 'a steal' for the low prices. the rooms are very tiny but well done up - the corridors are maze but blame it on the old building and construction. currently accessibility from the city is big problem because of the construction of Metro, but once that ends this hotel will be hot favourite for people travelling by the railways."
294,"the ginger has all the atmosphere of a businessman's hotel, but the rooms are clean and neat and staff is responsive to requests for assistance. the hotel is on the back side and across the tracks from New Delhi Station - and the constant activity makes the area relatively safe. you get courtesy bottles of water every day."
295,"the hotel is magnificent. it was so peaceful, no disturbance at all from anyone - it's not hard to drag ourselves away from it to go anywhere. its ambience is so quiet, there is nothing to disturb at any from any person. i would say this is probably the best hotel in the price range of Rs 1000/- per day."
296,"the hotel is just a stone's throw from the railway station. it was an unbelievable facility for the price at this location, with tea kettle and tea packs in the room. if you are planning to stay there, please make sure that you book your room well in advance."
297,"the area around the hotel isn't too safe, quiet or clean. it is just near the new Delhi station so u can imagine all that mess around and how is it at night."
298,Id give it 5/5/5. it is the best value for money option for all kind of travellers.It gives it a 5-star rating.
299,"the hotel is very neat and clean and for the price one cannot get a better deal. they also have restaurant, laundry service, LCD TVs in each room, etc."
300,"the family room contains 4 beds. with AC, pretty spacious room with LCD TV for 1000 is too good. also proximity the new Delhi railway station is BIG plus. now don't have to go for the infamous Pahadganj hotels."
301,the hotel is located on the North East side of the metro and New Delhi Railway Station. the staff were very attentive and the restaurant was adequate.
302,"this was one of my worst experiences!!! i finished a whole day work in delhi &amp; had to return to this hotel in the night. the arrangement for my stay was made by my office in Mumbai. I tired calling the hotel serveral times during the day to inform them that I have arrived, only in vain as no one answered the phone all throght the morning."
303,the service here is very slow though the food is nice. pre-paid auto-rickshaws are available at the new Delhi railway station which is a 3 minute walk away and the metro station is 3 minutes away as well.
304,good hotel to stay if you are travelling on business or work for a day or two. the facilities are minimal but adequate. 'good hotel' for business travellers.
305,we took a family room for just INR 1000. the hotel is just oppositte the new Delhi Railway station within the station premises.
306,ginger hotel is truly a business hotel for business traveler like me. they best advantage with ginger Delhi is its location advantage.the facilities provided by the hotel are above average.
307,ginger mgt serviced tata as the most trustable brand of world. it was a gud exp.. i can't even imagine service like the one he got.
308,food is available but is in cafeteria like place Had a few issues with them messing up over the bedsheets but was otherwise ok.
309,"a Basic Service Hotel, right next to New Delhi Railway Station. we wanted 'a Hotel Near Railway station' as we were transitting next day to goa by flight - stayed in the same hotel as ginger in Haridwar and Goa. the hotel was very clean and clean due to Metro work on in nearby vicinity, the railway station Parcel office etc making it very noisy and dusty.Rooms needed little bit more care (by guests as well as by staff)"
310,"ginger is the best budget hotel in new delhi, in area near railway station. all facilities like taxi, food, shopping are available nearby."
311,jus the place outside hotel is to be maintained.. the stay at hotel was awesome with excellent room amenities.and that too economical.
312,"we booked this as we were going to be catching a train from Corbett National Park into new Delhi station. but our driver had all sorts of problems trying to get to the front door and ended up parking in nearby car park! it's not in the nicest of areas, I definitely wouldn't advise walking around on your own at night."
313,"it is clean enough, although they do not provide sheets apart from the one covering the mat. it has what you need, and it's clean and clean, despite the price for room it provides.it is the central location, the hotel is a great value for money. if you stay stay in this hotel, stay at this luxlux hotel in the heart of the stts - stay! i love the location and the nice price of room you can stay here here."
314,the resteraunt is open 24hours with good food although the staff are very rude and unanattentive. downside is that there are no shops around the hotel and you need to get to them (Connaught Place 5mins) which are available just outside a hotel.
315,the hotel is decent &amp; as per Ginger standards. its located very conviniently esp if one wants to travel from NDLS station or arives these late at night.
316,"my friends and I booked a room at Ginger to save some money. the room came highly recommended by my friend's coworkers in Bombay, but we ended up not staying there."
317,the room service was quick and the food was satisfactory. the rooms were neat &amp; clean.I would recommend to the viewers to stay at this place.
318,"hotel is clean &amp; proper, has a good restaurant as well.Rooms are self sufficient, though small if you are looking at spending more than 3 days here."
319,"ginger was just what we needed for the final 3 nights of our 3 1/2 week stay in India. the room was immaculate (by western standards rather than Indian) and complete with a fridge and tea and coffee making facilities, TV, comfy bed, AC, etc."
320,"the restaurant / snack bar is good (try the plain dosa) it is a short trundle across the car park and through the little gateway from new Delhi railway station. the hotel has perimeter fence and security guard. Immediately outside, you're in an horrendous noisy tide of hand carts, jeeps and motorbikes etc."
321,"very nice clean hotel with good room facilities, good location just at Ajmeri gate 100m from NDRS and metro, nice stuff. hotel restaurant is a different story. it works like fast food and they had no croissants and breakfast like food at the morning even if listed in the menu. Same with fruit salad."
322,"we stayed in a double room costing just 999 rupees per night. the rooms are equipped with satellite TV, kettle, tea and coffee, fridge, celan bathroom with shower curtain - these are 'a rarity in India'"
323,"good value hotel, clean rooms very close to the train station. good choice for a nights stay in Delhi before your onward jurney!"
324,"the rooms are small, and one could compare this with Ibis in Europe. there is also a category with four beds at the same price if there are more people!"
325,"stayed here once alone and once with my wife in January 2009 for Rs 1200. hotel is a forty-five minute car ride to and from airports, don’t use rickshaw. rooms were Spartan but spotless on both visits. the restaurant had reasonable food and prices (Rs 60-100/entrée), but the menu was limited during any given meal."
326,"our family of 4 stayed in a double and 2 singles rooms (1000INR each) for 3 days. we arrived at the hotel which is located next to the NDLS railway station, and we got off and headed towards the lobby."
327,stayed at Ginger during a short trip to Delhi in January 2009 with friends. the family room has 4 beds for Rs.1000/night and has 2 towels in room meant for 4 persons and you need to ask them for extra towels. towels could be of better quality - they shed threads which stuck all over!
328,hotel was good and neat and clean. they are a no frill hotel where we need to fetch our water as well. the toilets and the bath does not have any buckets or mugs. no room service or bell boys are there.
329,we stayed in 12/2008 twice for 2 nights each in a family room which sleeps 4. the first time the room was not very cléan - but the second time it was. great price (INR 1000 per night)
330,we pre-booked a room in ginger hotel for our first night in Delhi. taxi driver had serious problems to get to the hotel as it is next to an enormous parking lot for rickshaws as well as the train station. he got us there and we were greeted by the friendly staff.
331,"my friend is stranded in Delhi because Ginger Hotel didn't honor her reservation. they had record of the reservation, but there were no rooms available."
332,"our 2 rooms over 5 nights turned out to be excellent. access to the hotel is cumbersome, but since we hired a private car, this wasn't the problem for us. the biggest issue was inconsistent housekeeping svc; e.g. some days we got only 1-2 towels or no TP for 4 people; one day no A/c at all."
333,"the hotel was a few mins walk to the train station and metro line so that is why we chose it. room was an adequate size, wooden flooring and clean and the toilet was very high - so when you were sat on the loo, your legs wouldn't touch the floor."
334,"the ginger hotel served the purpose of being a safe,clean bed for two nights. the good points were clean rooms, serviced daily, on site 24hrs cafe, close to the new delhi railway station, great for catching the shatbadi express at 06.15 to Agra."
335,"ginger hotel was an hazel to reach the hotel, with all the construction work going on around it. the staff at the reception were friendly and the room was clean and tidy. it was a good place to stay in the slams. i'd stay stay at Ginger hotel is the best hotel in new Delhi."
336,"this is the best value hotel I've ever been to. the location is good too, with Metro station right outside, and one metro stop away from Connaught Place (i.e., 5 minutes). the downsides - the shower area is a bit small and the beds are very light (which can be 'a bad thing if you want them to stay put)."
337,the service provided to me was through the hotel ginger in new delhi. the system of help yourself is catching up fast in india and price is fair enough to shell my wallet.
338,ginger hotel has all the facilities that any four star hotels would have. good bed and superb guest service. easy to check In. i prefer to stay in ginger Hotel.
339,excellent value for money. Neat and clean. within the new Delhi station. 24 hour medical shop and vending machine for late night hunger pangs.
340,"we have been there in sept 2008. we are directly located at new Delhi train station.Cleanest hotel we had in whole India in this price range around 1000Rs. reservation by internet or phone. TV, a/C, 24h warm water, clean linen."
341,I stayed for 4 Nights. the room was perfectly clean. I will definitely opt this hotel again if I visit Delhi againThe price was the great attraction. it cost just 1000 rupees. but it gave the facilities &amp; comfort of 4000 Rs room. superb..
342,this is a new Budget range Hotels from Tata Group operated with the brand name Ginger. the new budget range hotels are owned by the company's name ginger and also owns the Taj 5* Hotels in India &amp; Abroad. an existing 7 Floors Rail Yatri Niwas which was managed by Indian Railways has been handed over to Ginger Hotels to run the Buget Hotels and opened in august 2008.
343,"*Grand Godwin is a fantastic hotel, such great value for money. our first night was in the super delux, as our room was not ready. it had hairdryer and fridge, and was slightly bigger than the rest of our stay. the restaurant is 24 hr and the food is great. good breakfast too."
344,"we were there for several days, so re-negotiated the price after the first day based on comps, but then the management did not honor that when we checked out. if you make any agreements on price, make sure you (a) get them in writing and (b) have management sign off immediately, or you're screwed."
345,"stay at the Grand for one night on our way through Delhi to Udaipur. our room was comfortable and clean, check-in was quick and easy, and Wi-Fi is available. the roof-top restaurant offers an expansive breakfast."
346,"good hotel in a nice area, near metro station and interesting spots. Especially having breakfast at the roof top in the morning is really nice."
347,"I enjoyed my 3 day stay here. room service was very kind, food was excellent and the room was clean. it's centrally located and in an interesting area of Delhi. only negative is that I had constant trouble with internet (they gave me my fee back)."
348,"at the beginning of our tour of India, we first stayed one night in room 402. price of the room : INR 2,812.50 per night breakfast included. the neighbourhood is noisy but in the hotel, it is very quiet. they have a taxi service to the airport which we used."
349,"we had booked the semi deluxe room on their website a month in advance. the room wasn't too bad, by no means spotless, the usual peeling paint etc but it was pretty clean compared to some dives we'd previously stayed in India - the restaurant was OK and b'fast an interesting buffet affair but not awful."
350,"you can get eggs, fruit juice,tea, toasts etc no problem. don't forget to ask them NON SPICY, it will still have enough of flavor."
351,I made a reservation weeks before arriving in Delhi and specifically asked for driver to pick me up because it was my first time in India. they sent me confirmation with booking and pick up driver but upon arrival on the airport nobody was there.
352,"this is the best and also the most popular hotel in the area. the hotel travel desk can arrange a car from places to places no matter where you stay, and used cars for three days to save the hassles of negotiation everytime getting into local transportation if you want to stay there."
353,"Incredible India guys helped us with rearranging hotels for us in different cities. it was especially great to have them help me in the middle of the night, when we arrived from the airport first day."
354,"the room was terrible, very dirty and we found some cockroaches in the bathroom. the receptionist was a trickster, we booked it in advanced paying and they didn't keep our reservation, when we arrived we discovered that our room had been sold and sold for the same price."
355,the hotel is located in the slum areas around Delhi central station. they don't actually have the room they offer and want to make you pay extra. the attitude behind that makes you feel not welcome at all.
356,"hotel was promised internet access in rooms for 50rupees per night. internet only works on the ground floor in the lobby, so anytime I had to use it - it's clean and clean. breakfast on roof top is poor, only the omlette or cereal is worth eating, the milk had congealed fat in it."
357,the Grand Godwin is located in a street full of hotels. it's well located for convenience to new Delhi train station and is only 5 mins from the metro - but the restaurant is basic but we didn't use it apart from breakfast time. the inclusive breakfast is limited but adequate to stave off the morning pangs of hunger.
358,breakfast is a buffet set up and was cold and generally quite disgusting. you are better off going out to eat if you want to get discount by getting room without breakfast. evening meals meanwhle are overpriced and nothing special.
359,"the hotel is located in the Paharganj section of Delhi, and walking the streets of the city is quite an experience. the sidewalks are very narrow and often covered with street vendors, so it is usually necessary to walk in a street, with heavy traffic consisting of autorickshaws, trucks, cars, motorcycles and cows."
360,"i booked the hotel, they inform me your pickup is free at the time booking. but there is no taxi for me at airport in midnight. he charged very high price to me 50USD. breakfast quality is very bad. they charge me the room rent also high 1800INR + 22.5 Tax for one day. 50% paid to touts and autoriksha drivers. I can't recommend to any single lady, couple, senior citizen to stay this hotel hotel."
361,the hotel is extremely clean and well equipped. the staff are attentive and courteous and the package is what impresses me the most. a scammer stole my money (a crook that sold dodgy airline tickets) they went out of their way to help me in this situation.
362,"the hotel is located on a popular street, and is conveniently located near tre train station. the staff arranged airport pickups for us twice - and they were always there waiting for the train to catch us from the Dehli Train Station."
363,"the hotel was lovely, very grand and beautifully decorated. we opted for the deluxe (rather than semi-deluxe room) for 2400 rps a night including tax and breakfast. the staff were friendly and efficient, booking an airport taxi for us and arranging for breakfast in our room before our flight!"
364,the hotel is a 10/15 min walk from the main bazar or an auto rickshaw ride to Connaught Place is approx 50 rupees. the breakfast served at the roof top restaurant was particulary good.
365,"very clean hotel room found in new Delhi with Fare price. the staffs of the hotel, specially the front office are very helpful. all kinds of Delicious Indian foods are available. we had wonderful friendly service. my room is only US$45 per night with break first. hot water is available, a/C and big TV worked the room."
366,a'super deluxe' was 2500Rs per night and it was noisy outside. the breakfast buffet on the roof terrace was fine although I didn't sample the evening cuisine which was available.
367,"the bedding on both beds had many stains and soiled areas and seemed to have not been washed; bathroom was also less than adequately clean. the front desk asked for more money although this room was prepaid including taxes, firmly stated I would not pay and they backed off. location is desirable for good access to Delhi train station."
368,"the hotel's airport transfer is expensive, much better to use the pre-paid taxi stand at the airport. we were informed that it is due to be demolished and rebult in 2009. The rooftop restaurant of the Grand Godwin is clean, nice staff and the food good."
369,we arrived at 3 am and after battling with a pre-paid taxi driver who couldn't find the hotel arrived with the [--] they had us sorted and in our room. next day they requested to change and did so to the front street facing room which was fantastic. the breaky was great and hearty and the restaurant even served pretty good dishes for lunch.
370,"hotel Grand Godwin isn't a place you'd stay too long, but just fine for arrival and regrouping. if you are the oBeroi/Taj kind of traveler, go ahead and stay here."
371,no other hotel I've stayed at in India does breakfast like the Grand Godwin. our room was serviced daily and we also had a newspaper delivered every morning. the travel desk was helpful and able to sort out travel to Agra and back.
372,"if the hotel is full, they'll give away your room to anyone walking in off the street. you can confirm your booking, tell them when you will arrive, leave a copy of your passport, do everything they ask and they still will not hold the room for you. the staff at the GG reception is positively useless."
373,"great hotel to stay at, in the less touristy part of paharganj but does not suffer from it.the roof top bar is good too.Rooms clean, beds comfy.Will be going back to this hotel when I return to delhi."
374,"the main bazaar street is the centre of Paharaganj and is where a lot of the guest houses, bars and restaurants are. the hotel is located on the street that runs parallel to the train station but isn’t directly on it. if you’ve been to Thailand then this is closest thing to Khao San Road. more hectic as is all of India and less bars but the nearest thing in Delhi."
375,"the hotel is a short autorickshaw ride to many new Delhi sites such as India Gate, C.P., and museums. the rates are good, the rooms are clean and if I remember correctly they offer complimentary breakfast. all in all, one of the better values in New Delhi!!"
376,"we booked one night at the Grand Godwin, our first night in India and the airport taxi. if our experience was good and there was no extras charged by the staff we would book 3 more nights after two days in Agra. this hotel seems to be really trying to teach staff about service and what a western tourist might be used to."
377,"hotel staff tried to charge us an additional fee, saying we owed a luxury tax. we showed them our email receipt as we had booked through their website and they still continued to demand an extra $40 in rupees. it took them about 20 minutes to begrudgingly agree that we paid everything. this really left an sour taste in our mouth and we can only imagine that they try this trick on most people in the hope of getting extra cash."
378,"we went to india for a wedding and stayed in the Grand Godwin before and after. the hotel is clean, the rooms are wonderful and the bathrooms are very good with hot water. if you're up for it, you can catch the Metro to many major places and even Karol Bagh and Connaught Place (shopping)."
379,"if the manager is not there it's not possible to find a solution. they finally obliged you to pay the standard prices, even by mail, despite their agreement on the prices."
380,"the hotel is located in the heart of the city, close to cannaught place and the railway station. the recepcionist told me that the credit card machine didn t work, so as we didn't have enough ruppies to pay the bill we had to paid in euros, with this transaction they rise the original price because the exchange. if you take a train to any other place, once you buy the ticket and go straight to the platform to wait for the train, do not show it to anybody who ask"
381,"a 2-star hotel in Toronto would be classified as 4-star in Delhi. if you have to dish out $200-500/night, don't expect the hotel to be like one of the hotels in the same city as the Mehga Sheraton, the Madonna and the godwin Grand."
382,"a clean, well-maintained hotel in Delhi with reasonable rates. after 5 weeks travelling through india, it was comforting to find clean linen and well maintained hotel where everything actually works!"
383,the room service was a consistent problem; the night staff at the reception were rude and ill-trained. the over-friendly tourist is an exploited tourist.
384,"the hotel lobby is snazzy w/ marble and a glass elevator. the room (single, Deluxe) was on the smaller side but was clean and nice. it has fast internet in the lobby."
385,"the 2000rps cost included a good breakfast, but not an airport pick-up. modern bedrooms and helpful staff. The staff were helpful and friendly - and the rooms were clean and clean!"
386,"5 stars go for $400+ and all the rest just have very mixed reviews. the hotel was clean, very nicely appointed and service good. we were in room 309, a little noisy (but we slept fine) from the street, but we wanted to look out."
387,"hotel will aggressively try to sell you as many things as it can in terms of guided tours, etc. lobby is nice enough - and that's all they show you on their website."
388,"they gave us an 'employee room', not the superior room we booked until we paid an additional amount. travellers at reception yelled at the front desk managers because they were asking for additional money vs. the prepaid amount so this seems to be standard practice for this hotel. even when you show them their internet printed receipt and E-mails they won't give you a room until you pay an extra amount."
389,"we had travelled to India on a previous trip and stayed in the same area, Pahar Ganj. but the area was safe to walk around and convenient location. we arrived late at night and were quickly checked in and brought to our room, but our new room wasn't ready and we wanted to go sightseeing. the staff was very helpful and always pleasant."
390,this hotel for us was a good place to stay while in transit to other places. it is close to the train station which is handy and had good food at the restaurant. we found accomadation in delhi to be either too expensive or cheap.
391,room was very dark and dingy with only one window that lead to a concrete wall. we also had an outside guy outside our room all of the time who kept spitting. try to avoid as they clearly don't clean the sheets.
392,"we booked to stay here 12th October 2007 on our first night in india. we were picked up at the airport at gone midnight, and fair play to the driver, he waited a good while for us because our plane was delayed. the check in procedure is lengthy, but we eventually got checked in and taken to our room. our real problem with this hotel came with our 'CONFIRMED BOOKING'quot; for the last two nights of our holiday."
393,the hotel manager sent it outside the building to get a photo copy of my passport. he told me that my ID was not good enough and wanted copy and passport to be sent back to my room and I could now check in to the room. but I insisted that I get my license back before I move in because I did not want to take any chances with it.
394,my friend and I stayed in a &quot;suite' room with no window. the showers were open (no door/curtain).
395,"review prepared by two senior citizen couples that have traveled extensively in the far east and limited their hotel cost to between $20 and $40 US per room per night. stayed in this hotel on two occasions for one night each at a cost of $42 per day per hotel room including breakfast. Found hotel to be excellent. Rooms were clean, of sufficient size, central air conditioning and heat - and central hot water. breakfast buffet on roof was adequate but not extraordinary. hotel personnel were friendly, courteous and very professional."
396,"we stayed in this hotel for a few nights in Jan after being recommended to it by couple we met at another establishment. they pre-warned us that the sheets, although apparently cleaned, did have some mysterious stains - as if they'd been stored on the floor, and that was certainly the case. so we decided to book it for our last night in Delhi before we flew back to the UK."
397,"we arrived early morning to Delhi and a lift from the airport was arranged via the hotel. the room was fine, perhaps not up to European standards (good cleaning could help). staff was rather helpful. The best was the restaurant: quite cheap and really good (the most important: no problems whatsoever whatsoever afterwards)."
398,our stay at the Grand Godwin was simply average. it's located in the back street of Delhi and looks like a 'dodggy&quot; neighborhood'
399,the hotel is situated in the back streets of the paharhganj district of Delhi. the reviewer from canada has stated they d have internet access but i have just been informed that they charge 25 Rupees per hour and not free as it states on their card.
400,"this small, friendly, cheap, clean hotel is the best option in Delhi in the 3-star range. they have an internet connection that doesn't work superbly well but is free. and you can make cheap phone calls abroad. the restaurant is very decent."
401,I came to New Delhi to do a professional exam at Ramnath House Yousuf Sarai Community Center. all staff was very helpful and cooperative... especially the receptionist!
402,"staff is very courteous. I am very pleased with the staff. the owner/management should have good outlook and try to improve the condtions. air conditioning is not adequate, Staff maintains the rooms and bath rooms to their ability."
403,"the place was a little bit far from for example the city centre. Otherwise it was good. the hotel was quite good in terms of the rooms, amenities, facilities like the restaurant and conference setup."
404,we wre around 18 doctors stayed in Grand sartaj. execlent Hospiltality given by staff neat n clean place to stay at reasonble price.
405,"we stayed at this hotel for one night, out 1st night in Delhi, it was a horrible experience. the breakfast was terrible and overpriced.we did not stay here as we couldn't bring ourselves to enter the hotel again."
406,"the staff couldn't do enough for us, we left our safe open in the room while we went for breakfast and the boy making up the beds drew it to our attention when he could have easily helped himself. also when my husband was struck with Delhi belly, pretty inevitable, they immediately let us have our room for another night and made all the phonecalls to tourguide, taxi etc."
407,the front door staff told the driver three times he didn't know where it was yet they allowed him to leave. a taxi was arranged and we walked back to the hotel and waited for 15 minutes for the lifts to get directions before finding it. the staff said the fixed price was the mimimum price.
408,"the hotel itself is a tall tower, I think 17 stories if memory serves. the interior is spotless, businesslike, and modern. The rooms are really pleasant - excellent quiet AC, nice linens, modern furniture, plasma TV, safe, great views of the city."
409,"this is one of the good hotel located centrally in New Delhi. a bird's view is the most important point of this hotel. its away from airport but near to railway station.Rooms are clean, well decorated. Food is OK but very costly."
410,"we liked the restaurant with a view of trees. it's not the wild west as described by previous reviewer, but its safe."
411,this hotel located in the heart of the city is best suited to travellers whether on a pleasure trip or business. i had an evening flight to catch and my room was automatically upgraded from executive to deluxe upon my arrival.really appreciate their efforts.
412,"we had been to a conference in Delhi, We happen to stay at this hotel for two nights. every visit of mine was same with warm welcome. they serve welcome drink on arrival. the Rooms are on very higher floor with view of the city. it is just excellent."
413,staff and service was excellent. Location of the Hotel was good. close to shopping area CP of delhi.Timing and quality of breakfast were good.Overall it was a nice experience at Hotel stay.
414,the view of the busy roads of Delhi was quite a sight. the room size was adequate but the carpet could do with some vacumming. The house keeping surely could improve and the standard is clearly indicated from the towels that are kept for use.
415,"have stayed at this hotel about 5/6 times during my business visit. centrally located, very good restaurants, clean rooms and overall a very nice place to stay. my frequent visits were good enough for me to get upgrades."
416,"we stayed in the hotel as part of a package and it was very good. they upgraded our room as we were going to be there for 9 nights and the rooms on the 19th floor are big and clean, although the lifts erratic."
417,"the hotel was part of a tour package. my room was clean, the bed comfortable and staff very attentive to this tired travlers needs."
418,"excellent hotel although slightly overpriced. clean comfortable rooms. helpful staff, but extras such as tours organised through the hotel more expensive than at other hotels we stayed at."
419,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights for the start of a 3.5 week tour of India. the room, although not very large, was beautifully appointed.the breakfasts were great. Interesting Indian food as well as continental.good location - close to the (very clean and modern) metro line.I would definitely consider staying here again."
420,tripadvisor asked for a place in downtown Delhi for 100$ and quality. they quoted my 260$ on the phone and told them that they're site was 102$. the rates are all fine and it really is 4 star.the location is gold but still rickshaw is required as there are plenty of pathetic touts around the hotel.
421,"the hotel was part of a package that included airport to and fro transfers, transfers to train to Agra plus taj &amp; Fort tour. the package price was very reasonable - given the overall package cost it was quite reasonable. we got guide one day to tour Delhi itself then the other two days were arrival and the second day was arrival in the area of Connought. they said they felt safe both during the day as well as the evening."
422,"the inside of the Hans is clean, well looked after and the rooms are well furnished and a reasonable size. they are also high enough away from the street to shield you from traffic noise outside (remember, this is the centre of Delhi). the staff speak good English and were helpful and attentive to our many requests, at any time of day or night."
423,"the hotel is on par with a 4 star hotel in UK and all the amenities were present, like table, chairs, flat screen tv, nice king size bed,safe etc. the walls are quite thin so you could hear next door which was the only down side.Overall good place to stay to explore New Delhi."
424,Located close enough to many restaurants and shops but the hotel floors are high enough that you are not disturbed by traffic noises. very clean and nice hotel. excellent breakfast.
425,"stayed 2 nights at the Hans Hotel in November, 2008. Didn't actually stay in the room much, as I was on tours all day, both days. the problem was that I called Housekeeping 3 times to bring a power adapter, because my universal kit does not fit the power outlets in India. they kept saying 'yes' but it never came."
426,we booked three rooms for our family members on our way back to Auckland after the marriage of our son in Amritsar. the hotel looks okay but the office staff are terrible-eg I get a call at 11pm one night asking me when will I settle the hotels bill.
427,"the hotel is in the heart of the city and centrally located. there were so many issues including the additional dollars they charged for a cancelled night. from the bell hop, to the front desk clerk, there is no hospitality. I am not going to stay here anyone."
428,stayed at the Hans for one night because it was close to new Delhi railway station. the room was good enough and worthy of the 5 star rating of this hotel (As well as the high price for India)
429,stayed 2 days in the hotela great reward to end your trip in india. the best hotel i have ever been a bit expensive for india but worth it it.. stay 2 nights in 2days in hotel.
430,the food served at the Hans is better than all of the five star hotels that I've stayed at in New Delhi even though it is only a Four Star hotel. the staff was friendly and cooperative and the rooms were EXTREMELY clean. The buffet breakfast was also excellent...I recommend their doughnuts especially.
431,the Hans Plaza is a clean and centrally located hotel. the hotel offers one sense of comfort at what seems to be reasonable price for Delhi ($150 inc. taxes per night). overall staff was very friendly - but one must be careful of things:1. There are vast differences b/w the different rooms with regard to confort and age of beds etc.
432,"the resteraunts at the hotel are good, and offer a variety of foods to eat. they upgraded me the last day I stayed there to the deluxe room, which was very nice."
433,"the rooms were a good size and start on the 15th floor. it was great as I could watch the black kites circling in the sky outside from the room, which was good as i could tell by the buttons in lift (floors 5-14 were missing) we ate at the Kaffe restaurant on 2nd floor and found the food of the best food I've eaten!"
434,"Hans Hotel is a pretty nice place. the rooms are big, the views are nice and the restaurant is good. in fact, it was absolutely wonderful as they served beef! I cannot tell you how awesome that was. The staff seems pretty willing to help."
435,"the hotel provided a welcoming plate of fruit and cookies upon my late arrival after 1 am. the room was very clean, had flat screen TV, and nice little extras such as free bottled water and kettle. overall it was utilitarian rather than elegant, but the condition of everything was excellent."
436,"we stayed here as part of a private tour and I was impressed with the hotel. it's not in the same league as the big name hotels but I'd stay here again. if I were going to invest in something, I would buy the Travel Lodge franchise in India and set up low cost modern hotels!"
437,"stay at the Hans Hotel (no longer Hans Plaza) beginning of October. the rooms are on the 14 th floor, so there is an excellent view over delhi. breakfast buffet was adequate, but not a huge selection."
438,"Arrived in india in Delhi with prebookes premium double room for 3 nights at Hans Plaza. Spent $275/night including taxes thru Travelocity. this was in beginning of high season, end of September. arrived at midnight and was told our room was not available until the next day but they had an upgraded suite for our first night."
439,"an average hotel with lifts that dont workBeware of using their phone, I made a five minute call to the uk and they tried to charge me over £40. the location is good but the restaurant is overpriced.you can do better."
440,the Hans Hotel is well located in Conaught Place. it ia a bit poor hotel for the price. in Europe you would get an far better hottel fot the prices you pay. but Delhi in general is far more expensive than the rest of India in terms of hotels and I belive there is no mid range.
441,"flightcentre had rated this hotel as four star but when we arrived we were in for a real shock - the rooms were dreadful, small and pokey and threadbare. the hotel was one of the best hotels we have stayed in ever, so this was not an case of misunderstanding the quality provided in India."
442,"the Hans Plaza was expensive for a pretty average hotel stay. the hotel was well-located, within minutes of walking to Connaught Place and the area was safe. i suppose this may be good value in Delhi where hotel prices are known to be sky high at times!"
443,"good location, within walking distance to great restaurants, shopping and subway/metro station right around the corner.we stayed at this hotel during the last part of our trip to India, which was a relief for us."
444,"our stay at Hans was the icing on the cake. the hotel was a fabolous hotel run by an amazing team. Personalized but at the same time professional. thanks to the ever so friendly Front office team, F&amp;B team and the perfect service from the House keeping."
445,"the hotel is a 2 min walk to the metro - an excellent way to get around! Overall, Hans Plaza is highly recommended."
446,"stayed here as part of a tour group - but I've seen how expensive it is on their website. rooms were clean and comfortable and the hairdryer didn't work, but the staff were very friendly and helpful."
447,"we spent the first two nights of our Indian holiday in this centrally located hotel, close to shopping and with easy access to both New and old Delhi. the breakfast was good, though it felt a bit warm in the sunshine through the windows of this breakfast room. staff was unenthusiastic but adequate. we would stay here again."
448,"the hotel was moved to the second floor, our hotel directory stated it was on the top floor. the wait time for food was exceptionally long and the restaurant manager started shouting at them in front of customers. we could go on, but I think that is enough."
449,this hotel does not respond to e-mails and booking forms on the website. it does a great damage to an already bad image of Indian hotels.
450,"we booked the Hans Plaza via the internet for three people. at check out, we were charged an extra 25USD for the cot, which never arrived. when discussed with management they refused to amend the bill. the room itself was modern and clean- but pity about the terrible service."
451,"internet connection was done via WIFI and very expensive because it was so slow. the bar staff at the roof top bar were the slowest people ever, no imported beers avaliable. there was only a hand full of chairs no where to sit.the resturant on floor 2 was clean and newly decorated, but very slow again."
452,we stayed 2 nights in Hans Plaza at arrival and departure from india in febr-March 06. The room needed renovation but the second room on the 17th floor was OK with a superb view.
453,"stayed in this hotel as part of group a three families, on arrival in Delhi and just before departure. had no problems with our accommodation: it was clean and warm. restaurant staff charming. food excellent!"
454,"breakfast buffet is decent and the staff are very good and kind. the hotel lacks the facilities of pool, gym,etc., but they run a good show."
455,"we got to the hotel very late in the night...3am,the room was below average, the toilet looked clean but there was a nasty smell. to top it off though our electricity kept cutting out, it took 4 phone calls and the duty manager to rectify this. don't stay here if you can help it...disgusting service and manky rooms!"
456,i booked a room in indian rupees and told them its really not good cheating customers just because you can get away. the receptionist calculated the bill wrongly and cannot even do basic math like (16 + 18) and they charged me more than they quoted.
457,"the 3rd night I checked in there I was given a room on the 17th floor which was far inferior to their other rooms. complained but was told they were full. no bathtub, no coffee/tea facilities and not even bedspreads in the beds. in my opinion only 3 star standard for these rooms."
458,"I've stayed in Hans Plaza in September 2004. the rooms need renovation and the reception area is not that comfortable, but the staff was friendly and helpfull. Connaught Place and Janpath are 15 min. walk away."
459,the hotel is too expensive for what it is.PROSLocationCONSThey ripped us off with the taxi cost coming from the airport. use the prepaid taxi when you arrive at airport.not really cleanNoisyForget about the restaurant's restaurant.
460,"the whole area around this hotel is 'under construction', which made getting to it (and even finding it) quite difficult, it also didn't feel very safe at night. hotel staff were helpful, rooms were dodgy (run down and dusty) well overpriced, basically your paying for the city location."
461,it was a clean and economically priced hotel right on Connaught Place. the hotel was located in the heart of the city - just off the circle of st james's outskirts.
462,hotel 55 is an adequate hotel with a 70's styled interior which is quite in need of an update. it is centrally located in Connaught Place and thus convenient for exploring.
463,"hotel 55 is an excellent option to stay when exploring Delhi.Rooms are clean, staff are friendly, good airport pick up. be aware of unscrupulous travel agents that roam around and in the hotel."
464,"the 'quot;55' has friendly and unfailingly helpful management and staff, comfortable and clean rooms, and in the heart of New Delhi. the tariff is not bargain basement (but then what is cheap in Delhi nowadays?), but given its plus points I wouldn't stay anywhere else (although I would avoid the front rooms), which tend to be a little noisy!"
465,"hotels in Delhi are expensive, but for a thousand more rupees ($20), you can get nicer rooms that are welcome respite from the craziness that travel in India can be. rooms are small, bathrooms are purely functional but grotty and inconsistent, of our three rooms, only one shower actually worked; one provided hot water."
466,thes hotel it is very good and Comfortable and Good service and the most important thing in Central City I stayed three days in it. it was the best hotel in central city and it has a great location. the hotel was very nice and comfortable and good service.
467,"hotel 55 is a one star hotel with 15 rooms. the hotel is in Connaught place, in the city of london, scotland and the u.s. it is one of the best places to stay in this country. if you are traveling here, you should immerse yourself in their culture."
468,this is probably the worst hotel that I've resided in New Delhi. I requested the hotel staff to atleast spray some insect repellant but it fell on deaf years. the rooms were terrible and moldy. Avoid like the plague!
469,"hotel 55 from the lonely planet is the most squalid and disgusting place i've ever seen. the hotel website is incredibly misleading and claims to be 3 star, when I would question how it was ever classified as a 1 star. it ruined our experience of Delhi and I wish I had photos to add to my review."
470,"hotel website in this case is perhaps a bit misleading) but if you want reasonably priced basic accomodation then you can't go wrong. staff were fairly helpful. all in all, I was quite satisfied with what I got for my money. Could have paid less and stayed further out from the centre, but enjoyed waking up and having everything on my doorstep, seeing as it was 'a short stay'"
471,hotel 55 was the cheapest we could find but 3000rp (about $80) for this dump was a complete rip off. we only stayed there because it was too late to be lugging our backpacks around.
472,"the guy at the reception works with some locals that hang around in the 'lobby' who try to scam you every way possible. they did the whole phoning-the-airline-to-reconfirm-a-flight-and-discovering there-is-no reservation charade, selling ridiculously expensive tours that are crap, and every other scam they think you might fall for... this is absolutely the worst place i have stayed in while in India!"
473,at night there were permanently men sleeping in the corridor right outside our room. one was a skinny old man with big long beard - don't think he would have been much use in an fight. the owner tried to charge me for 2 nights despite the fact i'd paid online for the first night.
474,"the room charge they had up on the board was 1,000 Rups more than the Indiatourism pamphlet indicated, got into room and it was terrible, small grotty and generally crap. arrived late at night on train and didn't really have any other options at that time the hotel was already booked when we arrived we found that the charge was a '1000' rup plus the fee they were charged for the rooms was 1000 - compared to the indiatourism pplet's indicated and got in room"
475,"they overcharged me for the room and mistakenly paid without checking amount first. when I noticed, they admitted 'cheating' me out of money but refused to refund it. they said they would call the police if I didn't leave immediately without refund and would tell them that I had physically attacked the manager. all staff started nodding vigorously and I realised I was outnumbered and left having lost 2,500 rupees."
476,"we ended up staying here after our travel agent switched us last minute. by far, it was the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. staff were rude and dismissive, rooms were like a prison cell and really dirty."
477,hotel is ideal for a short stay and charges around Rs 4500/= per night for double room. it is located in the P block at CP and is situated in delhi's san francisco city centre.
478,"my wife and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in febr 2008. it was my 4th visit to india, and this is the worst hotel I've seen in the country."
479,unless you are on a budget ($80 and less) stay elsewhere. stay in leMeridian or Shangri-La ($300AU p/night)
480,"we booked a double room from Italy, looking at the pictures on their site. when we arrived the room was the smallest room I've ever seen and without even any WINDOW. the bath was terrific and very dirty and the bottles of water we found in the fridge were refilled as they were already open."
481,"hotel arranged airport transfer, it cost 925 rs really too much. the hotelier was keen to arrange tours but that put me off. most rooms have no natural light."
482,the hotel rooms are unclean and we had a job to get sheets and towels changed daily. the lazy room attendant reversed this to read 'please clean my room&quot; tag on the door' the coffee shop has about 10 waiters who simply wait and watch the TV despite being called for help several times. even the manager has no time for you. Overall it is the worst hotel we have ever been to so far in India.
483,"we left first thing in the morning and made our way to the hotel Vikram in Lajpat Nagar, south delhi, which was clean and lovely and smelled great. we wanted to be centrally located but didn't want to pay luxury hotel prices and Alka was recommended at the airport...the elevator was being torn apart in a lobby, that was ok, then there was the smell of the hallways with the rotting carpet, bad sign."
484,"the alka hotel is a relatively clean and tidy small hotel, but the decor is old. one small hallway on the second floor has mirrored walls and ceilings, and the lobby walls are adorned with fancy gilt-framed mirrors! are the owners of this place also in the mirror business???"
485,travel agents booked this hotel for us for two nights. we were booked into a deluxe room which gave notice of what was in store for our guests. the hotel is text book definition of an'seedy hotel'
486,"the lady at the desk kept answering the phone instead of checking us in. the room was hurrily cleaned, the bathroom was worn into and the place smelled of stale urine."
487,"the staff speak/understand very litle English, our promised (confiremd via email) hotel airport pickup service never arrived and we never got a clear explanation of why... the rooms are small and old. they are dusty, toilets leak, bathrooms have broken tiles, the tv signals are very poor and often not there at all."
488,"the hotel would be lucky to score 2* in any other countries. stayed in alka for 3 nights, do not believe the 4* rating, but it would have a 'city tour' if you're in it, try to arrange your own taxis as well as the receptionists only call their chums who charge you through the nose and refuse to switch on the meter."
489,"staff were rude, and were aggrieved when we didn't give them a tip. Avoid. stay in south Delhi instead."
490,our room was cleaner than the Hotel Perfect (see my other review) but what really was astonishingly bad was the service. the staff were intent on getting tips from us and b) entering the room for various'reasons'
491,"stayed for 3 nights. the room was clean and the staff was the best.. good hotel, would recommend to anyone. great hotel. staff were exceptional. Oh and they also had Wi-Fi."
492,we stayed here for 5 nights in total (spread over three separate visits) it is what I would call a basic 3 star hotel.
493,"there was supposed to be an airport pickup in the deal - that did not happen. the room had NO windows, the bed had a bottom sheet and on the top was just an ice-cream blanket and no top sheet. I was charged double the fee back to the airport than the amount I paid for taxi to this hotel as well and it was driven by someone connected with the hotel. this was listed on an international hotel site and I have written to them about my concerns about this place and note that they are no longer on that site "
494,this was our first stop in India and was organised through the tour company. the hotel was only about 50m away from the main shopping street and if you need a landmark then 'Punjabi Sweets' is in the same lane.
495,"a clean place, friendly staff, good place to startAn India tour. the breakfast was excellent and the staff were very helpful. I cannot imagine the better place.a simple but tasty breakfast. Nothing more to be desired[as far as hotels go]."
496,"the staff went out of their way to help us negotiate prices before we jumped in. the breakfast was always hot, timely and very tasty. The Massala Chai was to die for; we ordered it everyday without fail."
497,"the hotel Aster Inn is well located, within reasonable reach of new Delhi centre (2 stops on the developing Delhi Metro) the service was great, and the manager was accommodating and helpful with all of our enquiries."
498,"theze people have real pictures on there website of the room they were havin,i got one of them...yeppei...room service was quick in the morning,nice room, well decorated &amp; good staff with a smile."
499,"the hotel itself looks okay until you get to your room... the bed had a bottom sheet, and that's it! I asked for one and got another single sheet. I pulled it off and told them to replace it, but was told it was clean!! the staff are not 'Qualified &amp; Trained Staff' as their web site states!"
500,"the hotel was situated in what was not a great area. it was also close to the metro, making it easy to get about without having to shout for taxis."
501,"the hotel is a comparative oasis to the bustling and grubby streets that surround it. the rooms are clean and comfortable, with adequate showers, and the staff are generally attentive (even calling to ask if we wanted beer...) breakfast was painfully slow in arriving - half an hour for toast stretches credulity."
502,staff were extremely friendly and helpful on arrival at the hotel. they all went out of their way to help us whether it was directing us to a local hot spot or providing general tourist information. the breakfasts were delicious and the traditional masala tea addictive (room service was efficient!).
503,"hotel staff was very courteous, helpful, efficient and speaking perfect EnglishI suggested the hotel to offer internet access. the room looked new and well decorated - enjoying air-con and hot shower was no problem, and there was even a fridge!"
504,"new Delhi hotel is crazy expensive in Connaught place and not worthed. if you choose other convenient area, the hotels are old and the area is dusty, noisy and old!"
505,telephone booking is always confirmed whenever I have stayed here. check-in is smooth. Sevice is good. breakfast is complimentary which is a plus.
506,"we chose this hotel after hours of searching on the internet and reading in books as there is so much choice in Delhi. the hotel offered a free pick-up from the airport but couldn't manage to get through to them to arrange one. they refused to pay for our taxi when we arrived, and also declined to take us back to airport the following morning to compensate - the room was very dirty and there were flies and even cockroach in the bathroom."
507,"the hotel charged us RS 900 which is what you normally pay for renting the car for a whole day. prepaid taxi will cost us 250, but the driver told us that we had not paid for the trip in advance. that made us very angry and we will never recommend this hotel to anyone."
508,"hotel did not honour our booking through Hotels.com on 17 – 20 April 2009. we were travelling with two children, one 3.5 and the other 18 months. the booking was for the night of 17 April 2009. we arrived in Delhi at 2 am in the morning of 18 April."
509,this hotel is one of the small hotels located in crammed up localities of Old Delhi.It is recommended if money and price are a issue for you.
510,"the room is clean, and the hotel price is reasonable cheap!. the staff is nice, asked me for water several times, but finally charge me 50Rs, it's OK!"
511,"we booked a suite thru expedia, selecting the hotel based on its free airport pick up advertised. we arrived at midnight, no one was there. Eventually we were met by their employee who got us cab. the driver got lost. We gave our itinerary # and we gave the room. no problem, we would get is sussed out in the morning, I was too tired to argue."
512,we had two different rooms - one at the back looking towards the mosque and another on Asif Ali road side. the air-con worked (which in July was essential) the bathroom was clean.
513,i liked the place while my stay with some of my friends. it was anice place to stay. you could enjoy a nice location to live as well as an area to wander about.
514,"wakep up by the mosque every morning at 6 am is not my cup of tea. the hotel is very old, and the staff is helpful, despite the old hotel's staff are very nice, the room is old and it is a good place to wake up and wakes up at 6.am every night at 6:00 am sams is the best thing i would never go back to sleep, I would always return for dinner, my family would not be able to stay if he is awaken every day at"
515,the service we received was quite good. we had to leave at 7:30 to continue onto Agra and the staff very kindly gave us some breakfast (we were a bit too early for the buffet breakfast).Thugs Bar is also quite fun :) We wanted to try the restaurant in the hotel as well but didn't get there (going by all accounts its meant to be fantastic!)
516,"the Broadway is not the lap of luxury, but a solid mid range hotel in the heart of Delhi that exceeded my expectations. if you are looking for cheap and not in Paharganj, you can go to the theatre to drink."
517,"stayed in a mixture of rooms for approx 4 nights - 2 nights in cheaper rooms which were dirty, noisy and old. upgraded to most expensive rooms at front which had been refurbished for far greater price only to find out that they too were noisy (as all rooms are adjoining with thin wooden internal door so you can hear everything from other rooms), no hot water for days, sheets covered in human hair. the bar is seedy as they come, food overpriced and general hotel over-rated. were going to"
518,the resteraunt chor Bizarre was very busy and the food seemed more for tourist but there are really good vegetarian places only a few blocks away.
519,"we enjoyed our stay at hotel Broadway. the room was OK, the breakfast was good and the staff were very friendly. we ate at the restaurant several times and really loved everything we ordered, in particular the gulab jamun."
520,this hotel was booked as part of a package tour of Rajasthan and Agra. it lived up to most of the reviews - an average sort of place.
521,"my son and I had dinner at the hotel's much praised restaurant, Chor Bizarre, in 2004. the restaurant was a diappointment, with breakfast offered just two kinds of eggs and few other dishes. my single room had one window: it looked out onto the corridor."
522,"the Broadway is on asaf Ali Rd right next to Delhi gate and is ideally located for exploring Old Delhi,Jama Masjid and the Red Fort. the downstairs restaurant is excellent and always busy with Indians and foreigners alike."
523,"we were 9 persons staying at this hotel for some days. I booked there because I had read about it in a Lonley Planet Guide, but we didn't like it because:- the single room had no window!- Outside our room there was an mosque (very noisy very, very early in the morning!!)- The staff was not very friendly or helpfull.- but the corridor and the lift were hot!"
524,"this hotel was good value, not luxurious but good size room, good shower room. was attatched to chor bizzarre restaurant which is very nice!"
525,"a windowless room is the dirtiest hotel room I've ever received. the room was very hard, with previous guests hair, dust, and so on. I slept very poorly the 2 nights in the hotel."
526,when we arrived at the Broadway early in the morning we were shown to room 26. this room had clean beds and clean bathroom facilities with reasonable aircon. the receptionist advised that our'superior room' was now ready. it's worth checking to see what room you are in.
527,"the hotel was clean, but given the conditions of the room next door (two feet from our beds) I would not pay US$100 for this room."
528,"stayed at the Broadway hotel for two nights on arriving in Delhi. it is close to the red Fort, and Chandni Chowk (a maze of narrow streets and alleyways full of shops and Indian life)"
529,the rooms are more or less well maintained and well furnished.Kitchen is also good.Location is probably out of way.Food is good and enough choices.In short good value for money.
530,"i am a business person from Bangalore and am happy to share my experience of my stay in Hotel C Pak Inn. the hotel has been in delhi for 4 days and is located in karol bagh, santa thailand, in the heart of the city of london."
531,"despite several inconveniences during my stay here, I stayed here for 4 days. it is located very well in Karol Bagh and the services you get from the management/staff are good. they advise you in a very firm tone with travel advices etc - you don't feel that they are giving you that particular advice in order to make some rupees (which is something I have often felt when talking to the hotel staff in India)."
532,"I stayed at this hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. the rooms were really clean and the staff was real friendly and knowledgeable. I would definitely stay here again again, no question."
533,the manager can give you good advice. the hotel is a good budget hotel. nice manager en staff.excellent staff - nice staff staff and helpfull.shops are close and also the metro station.you can book your trips in the hotels.the manager is very helpful.
534,the C Park Inn is one of the best! the rooms are clean and comfortable. the staff is very frienbdly &amp; helpful. and you can't beat the price. this is my SECOND stay here and I plan to stay there again when I return to India. i give the c park inn my very best recommendagtion!
535,"this hotel is clean and comfortable, with good facilities and helpful staff. i have been travelling in india, visiting various cities, and my experience of staying here was far better than in some other places. there were no hassles, the staff were helpful and friendly. they made my business trip no less than a pleasure!"
536,"the best thing about this hotel is the nice cheap currys, the friendly staff the giantic beds and they offer cable which has a few english speaking channels."
537,"the hotel is filthy, the staff are dishonest.Room service tried to charge 200 INR for 2 bottles of coke (menu price less than 40 iNR)"
538,we got a warm welcome but it went downhill from there. the room was dirty and smelly and we couldnt eat it as it wasn't cooked right! security was in the hotel and once youve stayed there anywere else will seem lovely.
539,"the room itself - with a window which was too small to see the wall on the other side of the'street&quot; was some how clean. the basin was broken, the water was so strange that you couldn't use it for brushing your teeth. only towel I got during the whole stay was dirty and had some stains from someone who was spitting pan in it, you will have just one winter blanket, which is useless for temperatures like 20 to 30 degrees in the night."
540,"we stayed there for 3 nights in January. it was by far the worst and most expensive room we had in our holidays. stay away from this [--] hole and look in Lonely Planet for decent rooms...Regards,Christophoph...and look at the decent room... i'd stay here for the rest of the year if it's a shame to stay in the london hotel - we'stayed here despite the fact that we didn't stay there until the end of"
541,"this place is not remotely acceptable even to a backpacker, certainly not at GBP20/night in India. the front desk, these places seems to spend their whole budget on the lobby alone!"
542,"dirty place we had ever stayed, expected better in delhi. smelt of Shitand Urine, may be the Delhi aroma as all Indian ciites now a days."
543,good hotel!It was great. we had a clean comfortable room. checkin &amp; Checkout service was excellent& amp; quick - quick.
544,no airport pick up unless advance payment...reservation did not mean anything......endup picking up taxi (300rs for two)salty running water and it is yellow (non filtered from river yamuna)other people airport picked up was charged dubble becuse diffrent flight....promished 175Rs per person.
545,it was a bit quite.Good Security!Room and bathroom were clean.Bed was so comfortable.Everything was Good.
546,"I stayed for one night here and found it fine. nice staff, good location, airport shuttle came quickly and was resonably priced, the phone worked, as did everything else in the room."
547,"broken toilet, broken and filthy fridge, and broken air conditioner. rooms smelled like dead fish. don't even think of a good nights rest here."
548,hotel consulted me a tour which was great recomended by Raman who runs Akshat Tours and Travel. the hotel was very nice and loved it so much.
549,"there was no hot water, the room was dirty (but not crawling!)) and many fittings were broken. there were a lot of (friendly)staff who never seemed to do anything unless you actually gave them the bin to empty - but it was just about OK for me, but I could not recommend it if you are desperate to save your last dollar."
550,"this is not a nice hotel. it is basic but not at all clean. hotel is currently undergoing building work and there is constant drilling, welding and hammering from early am til late at night. the food was okay and the staffwere nice enough but forget it."
551,I stayed in hotel Chand Palace 2 nights and i was very happy to know this hotel where the employees are very kindly with guests. I will recommend the hotel to my friends.
552,food quality is too good. the hotel is well built n neat &amp; clean place to hang out and for function purposes also for functions purposes.
553,stayed here for 4 nights with my family. the rooms are big and clean - the service is absolutely fantastic. we ordered room service one evening and the food was with us after 10 minutes and was delicious! the buffet breakfast was included.
554,"the modern hotel is a good distance out of the city but the metro link nearby is good. the rooms were very nice. no problem with the mentioned pigeons, room on 7th floor overlooking the park."
555,the whole of the hotel has only purchased around 9 hours for a 15 day period. if my PA was not my wife I would sack her and would not recommend this hotel.
556,"the place is lovely, the staf are great and the food fantastic but expensive.the only other issue was the expensive internet connection. the internet is not a problem."
557,"city park is a modern 7-storey hotel on the northern edge of Delhi. the hotel is easily up to 4* european standards, close to 5*, and is accessible by the main routes in and around Delhi."
558,"we stayed there 3 times over 3 weeks and each time the internet was down which was pretty annoying. clean rooms, nice breakfast and good gym (for India). basic business hotel. a good breakfast - clean and clean. good location!"
559,"the hotel was a good 1.5 to 2 hours drive from the centre of Delhi. some members of our Group had previously arranged to eat out in Delhi, but this would not have been possible. the food was very nice, though terribly expensive even by London standards.the biggest problem we had was that of sleep (or lack of)."
560,"the hotel is so far out of the city centre that it is difficult to use as a base for your own sightseeing. we stayed in this hotel twice, one night at the start of our tour, and then again just before we were due to fly from Delhi. the staff in the bar were really nice, though we found the drinks pricey on Indian standards. they did get overwhelmed at checkout time, as all guests are being picked up together."
561,"this hotel was part of the Golden Triangle Trip (so hotels booked for us). we had stayed at The Oberoi Maidens, Delhi for 3 nights at the beginning (which was excellent) so this Hotel was depressing, by comparison-even though the food was fine."
562,"the tour company (Hi-Tours) put us in this hotel for two nights. we had stayed at a budget hotel in Delhi on our own - the city park is totally remote, far from anything and the former mall next door is empty except for cookie store and an optical shop. the staff was rude and inefficient."
563,"the hotel was arranged for us as part of a tour so we didn't have any choice in where we stayed. we arrived in the evening, having spent most of the day travelling up from Goa, and had delayed flights and the possibility of missing our connection (which we did not, thanks to tremendous efficiency by Kingfisher Airlines staff)."
564,we stayed at City park as part of a tour around india. the rooms were big with all modern ammenities - it is quite far from the very centre of delhi but you get taxi's everywhere anyway. nice hotel.
565,staff were very friendly and helpful the environment with in a hotel was gud. food was excellent specially yellow chilli...an indian restaurant...
566,"despite having a confirmed reservation, I was rebooked at the City Park Hotel. the hotel is not the most centrally located, the rooms are clean and the customer service is exceptional."
567,"the staff at check in were cordial rather than friendly. we were pleasantly surprised upon arrival as the lobby and surrounding areas looked welcoming, spacious and well laid out. our departure next morning was early and we had to be at the airport for around 6.00 a.m."
568,the hotel derives its name from a city park directly opposite which provides pleasant area to walk without the hassle of New Delhi streets. unfortunately open public urinals line the side of the street and the smell can be over powering on hot day. rooms are well appointed and beds are comfortable.
569,"the front desk staff were very good, the food was good and the room was clean. the hotel is very far from the main part of the city - it took me 1-1/2 hours to meet a friend at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, and 2-1/2 hour to the Baha'i Temple."
570,"the distance of Delhi's main attractions like Lodhi Gardens, India Gate, Bahai Temple and Old Fort is atleast 20Kms from here. there is absolutely no attraction around this hotel.this hotel also has mind boggling banquet business where marriages/family functions are organized making it a nuisance for the residents because of the noise and people which frequent in 100s every single day."
571,"we stayed here as the 1st night of our golden triangle tour. it was the best of the 3 hotels we were staying at - very clean, good rooms, and good service. the breakfast was not so good but we got much more than we expected.it was overall excellentand i will definitely stoy here again on my next visit to delhi."
572,"we stayed in 5 hotels whilst in India and this was one of the best. the hotel is very much a hotel catering for the business traveller, however, it will take around an hour due to the shear volume of traffic."
573,"we saw this Hotel rated as a 5 star and recommended by all major airlines. all staff were atttentive but held out their hands to make their wages, not tips. other people we met in the Hotel had the same experience - all were underpaid yet room rates were from US$200 per night."
574,i was at Clark heights to meet my girl friend came from Dubai. after reaching there we have found that safe and nice pl;ace in the main city off course nosiy like Delhi. under one roof all the services available for the travelers. from pick up to drop.
575,"staff on reception were nice and friendly, with the exception of the travel agent who charged extortionate prices for hiring hotel taxis and double charged us (service charge) for booking train tickets to Amritsar."
576,"the staff changed their pricing on us many times (and of course, they over charged us) they don't have a restuarant although they say they do. every person you see in the hotel expects high tip for doing nothing - they have internet, but it is the computer they use at the front desk. Overall, this was the worst place I have stay at in India and the price was one of the highest."
577,we booked 10 rooms for the marriage purpose for three nights stay. hotel staff was very helpful speciall the lady at reservation helped us alot in arranging the batchlores party at the basement. this is very near to our house and the wedding location. all aur family members came form different parts enjoyed and cherish the stay over there.
578,we stayed at Clark Heights for 5 days in November. original my boyfriend and I were given the wrong room - we had paod for a super deluxe but they put us in the delux. some of the staff were very nice but we were charged extortionaly for booking taxis with the hotel (including car to Agra) and service charge on train tickets were high.
579,"this hotel is currently undergoing building works so you are staying on a construction site. the rooms were basic, but the reception staff were helpful, except for the woman who arranged our trip to Agra and Amritsar. this was after she had told us that the whole of Delhi would be closed on one of our days there, which we found later wasn't true. there was always someone available to drive us places, though at an expensive cost."
580,paying more money than the nearly hotels we expected more standard butthere was seepage in our rooms and it was smelling. we do notunderstand as to then give the room to customers..
581,cheating travelers coming for 1st time to india. high price hotel/ guest house. I book room from internet. no pick up and no refund. 80 Kms. small taxi for 15 Rs. 1 km.
582,"the hotel has a nice location - yes, there is noise from the streets. but nothing you couldnt live with.Friendly staff an ok restaurant with cheap food."
583,"the hotel is good for those people who visit first time in india bcoz here. the rooms are very nice and specious I love to give **** star for this hotel. only problem with our taxi driver that is to fast.I like the location of the Hotel in on the main road and they have own parking facilities plus market is also very near to this place. Here, Reception staff is extremely helpful and well behave..."
584,the staff was really good and the food i had there was delisious.. as a wnt to d hotel he was impresd by the intrir.................the staff were really nice and coperative.
585,"the hotel was clean, room mid size.No pick up at the airport. Very noisy all night.Staff was nice location was ok."
586,all my out of town tours to amritsar n Agra were very well arranged. the only thing I think They could improve upon is the toilet ameneties and external facade.
587,"we booked hotel clarck online because it was easy. as expected we were picked up at the airport. the rooms were not as nice as the photos online, at all. we arrived late so had little choice, the y cheat us badly.. i arrived in Nov in Delhi with my family."
588,the hotel is on a busy road so we had no sleep the whole night. charge is quit high compared to the services. we do not recommend it to any traveler from USA or Europe.
589,the interior of the hotel is very impressive and I must give a special compliment 2 hotel staff too because they managed it very well. the service is really up to the mark and what I liked the most is its location. i mean its too easy to get to other places from here which was our prime requirement during that trip.
590,"the staff was courteous, freindly and very helpful. the rooms were nicely done and clean. they even helped us in getting few things that we had missed to carry along. thsi hotel would definately go back and stay ther.e every time i visit Delhi."
591,i had been to hotel Clark Height for 2 nights and 3 days. the staff was excellent and the rooms were clean and comfortable and a king size bed to relax urself.
592,the hotel fails to pickup me from airport even the service at night was not good. I booked this hotel from internet as it failed to pick me out of airport and was unable to get to a hotel in the u.s.
593,"I went to india last month for a business trip and stayed at hotel Clark Heights. the rooms were immaculately clean, the bedding and pillows were heavenly, and the bathroom and dressing area was very nice.Enjoyed my visit. I would definitely go back."
594,"we just returned from a 6 nights stay at Clark Heights hotel at new Delhi. the hotel is in an crowded road, but accessible to the mero which is about one km away in walking. it was very clean and the bathrooms were sparkling and fresh."
595,"this is decent hotel if you want to live around patel nagar, but it is on a busy intersection, so be careful to while booking room. do not book room by metra side, or you will not be able to sleep. hotel staff was very good."
596,the Clark Heights hotel was clean and well appointed with a flat panel TV. the hotel room was good quality and the staff were very helpful.
597,"the rooms were dull and not clean (a thick layer of dust covered most of the furniture); the bathroom consisted of a shower, an overflowingtoilet and bucket; the ceiling was covered with small flies. the hotel was noisy (children running around and constant unidentifieddripping in each room during the whole night)"
598,the photos that the hotel uses for promotion totally fail to capture what you get at this hotel. go to Tripadvisor for photos of those who actually stayed here. This hotel is very old and run down. in the room the ceiling fan is too loud to run and to turn off the lamp next to the bed you have to unscrew the bulb. there are stains on the sheets which show cleanliness is not part of this manager's mentality.
599,"housekeeping manager is really helpful, all the staff members are really nice. even there travel desk is very helpful for us.awesome nad enjoyable trip!!!! gr8t memories!!!"
600,"the hotel is located in a busy, noisy and rowdy area. the staff are curteous and always at one's service."
601,"the hotel is well positioned, the staff are very friendly and fell over themselves to organise trips for us. rafiq Khan who operates through hotel for Indian Tribal Tours arranged us to have a driver for the say to enable them to see all the sights in the safe knowledge of having an car waiting for them - lovely friendly people and I owuld recommend both the hotels and people higlhly to all."
602,the air con make so much noise that you can’t even get a nap for 5minutes not recommended. room is ok but all fixtures are old.
603,a normal hotel is on the road with lot of traffic noise allnight. they took $70 from me which is overpriced for the service and the kind of room which was given to me.
604,"the hotel arranged to meet &amp; collect us from new Delhi Railway station at 6.30am. check in was friendly and efficient, and we got a free upgrade. the room was spacious enough, everything worked fine and the included breakfast was very good. recomment this place for anyone passing through Delhi."
605,"this hotel is in a very busy are. Therecharges are higher and services are not at all good. we checked out of the hotel next morning and the reception took 30 minutes to check usout. the bill was not ready and excuse was that there is someconfusion. if I had an flight to catch, I would have missed it."
606,"the hotel has its reception area open to a very undesirable tour operator. he was present bothering tourists on all 3 days we where there, and infact made an internal telephone call to our room to try to arrange to meet us to sell his tour services - despite this negative first impression, the food was great as was its price, service could be better. hotel pick up was relaible. front of house staff attentive, but aloof at times."
607,this hotel was just fine. its a little pricey but then so are all hotels in Delhi. we arrived having booked in advance and check in was very smooth. in the first room given the toilet leaked so we asked to move. this was not an issue as other rooms were available.
608,"i made the booking through web and finaly landed to clark which is located in a busy street. was realy surperised once we enter, it was really cutting you from outer busy environment to clean atmosphere where you can easily relax in clean rooms, staff was REALy helpful, free breakfast and free pick up from airport is really big advantage, will visit again november, thanks to there hospitality."
609,"me my wife stayed here for a good 3 days good but not that good too. breakfast was average. high price for hotel like this, they have arrangement with bad travel agents and they took almost more than double price to tour to jaipur. we know from our friends who did same tour in quiet fewer prices, car and hotel were same. Rippled off."
610,"our travel agent booked this hotel for 1 night but we arrived very late at night there and ended up to book 1 more night directly at the front desk who were very polite,gentle and helpfull always. next day mor ning we were planning to get around the city but had no idea what to do in an unfamilliar place. the service is ok &amp; most of the time we had our meals on the rooftop restaurant with quality dishes.Breakfast in the morning could be better with some other"
611,Delhi's hotels are expansive compare to other cities. Use travel sites to get good deal. a good airport pick was very helpful.
612,the rooftop restaurant served excellent breakfasts and no fuss late evening meals/refreshments were delicious. all staff were attentive and helpful- any small niggles were dealt with efficiently with a smile.
613,"i booked an executive room in this hotel for a one night stay, which included an airport pickup. the room was clean (though small in size) including the linen. The staff were friendly and all queries were looked ater. will definately recommend the hotel to anyone who wishes to stay.and yes the bed is amazing!"
614,"the travel desk of the hotel very helpful &amp; friendly Mr. Rafiq. the rooms are very clean, food good too..."
615,the staff at the front desk were really helpful and gave great directions to the various places I wanted to go to. the room while not large was still well kept and the open rooftop breakfast area/restaurant was also nice kept.
616,"Fab hotel is a bit pricier than some in Delhi - £30 per night. but it's worth the money if you're off the plane, and trying to find your feet."
617,"my wife and I stayed here for 2 nights in august 2009 and were pretty pleased overall overall. the hotel is lovely inside, the room was spacious and the A/C worked - the restaurant was pleasant & the staff were more than helpful. The bathroom was somewhat grubby but that is a recurrent problem throughout India."
618,this is great little hotel which has great value. breakfast is included in the price and is very good. the rooms were really comfortable and clean. we booked to stay there again at the very end of our trip and we got the most gorgeous room with a bath and fabulous shower.
619,we are only staying for two nights and booked on the basis of Trip Advisor reviews. it represents excellent value at around 20 pounds per night. the room is clean and the aircon works (a must in Delhi in July).
620,"stayed at the hotel with wife and 3 year old and got a king size bed as asked for. room was decent size and quality was ok without being extraordinary, but for the price we paid you couldnt complain. the area around hotel is very noisy and if your light sleeper like me then that will be fine. for food we ate at Pizza Hut round the corner but beware of taxi drivers in the areas as when we asked directions he said its 5 miles away and its 100 ruppee ride"
621,"we booked our stay at hotel Clark International before we left home. the hotel was in a good location, but the drawbacks were that there was construction happening on the rooftop which woke us up in the morning, they tried to charge us for items n the fridge we didn't drink, and phone calls were pricey."
622,"the expedia rate is almost 1/2 the price of the published rack rates, so it was hard to resist! we booked (and prepaid) via Expedia a premium room."
623,"I booked the hotel for a stopover before my international flight from goa. the room was nice and clean, but the bathroom was ok too. they charged me INR$600 to take me to the airport the next day."
624,expedia was half the price of the published price but the hotel happily gave us the same rate for our other stays. the rooms were clean with LCD TV and really comfortably pillows!
625,"the things i really liked about the hotel were room ambience, room cleanliness, hospitable staff, top floor open air restaurant, proximity to market place and metro station, food(taste). the let downs: room service - sometimes took ages and food was little spicy,lack of variety in food choices, AC- almost non functional. if someone is looking for a decent acco in karolbagh area, would recommend to try this one."
626,"the staff were amazingly friendly and very personable. they assisted us in all aspects of our business helping us with leads, the hotel stay and anything we needed. our sister and I staye dat this hotel for a business purpose."
627,"I &amp; my husband stayed at Hotel Clark International at the beginning, middle and end of our trip at New Delhi. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay especially because of the very friendly, accomodating and warm behaviour of a hotel staff. I was especially happy because the in -room Safe, the mini bar and the Complimentry Tea/Coffee, Breakfast, and airport pick ups."
628,the hotel failed to pick us up at the airport when we arrived at 6.15 AM. the reception fixed a room to us and we could sleep for hours before starting off for the city - after complaining we got another room (on the 2nd floor) the Clark International is located in the Karol Bagh area which is quite convinient as it is close to the new and rather impressing metro.
629,the hotel requested my credit card information for a confirmed reservation. they never mentioned this to us when we called from the airport for our transfer to the &quot;hotel down the road'
630,"we spent 5 nights in total over 2 different periods at the hotel. we paid £86 per night for the Executive room. this includes airport pick up, breakfast and complimentary wi-fi. hotels in Delhi do appear to be expensive."
631,"it was their third offer of a room before we decided it would get no better. the so called romantic roof terrace restaurant did not serve wine and the roof of same is lined with bamboo, above which numerous pigeons reside, dropping feathers etc into one food while dining. only one of our party(of three) was sick over five days, but we spoke to another resident whose friend was confined to their room for couple of days with food related problems."
632,our room was very small with a heater and A/C unit that looked like they were made 50 years ago. the TV was also dated.
633,"hot water was in fact just warm, so shower in the morning was challenging. heater in room didn't work properly, but plugs needed support to stay plugged. a good price for CAD215 (USD 180) is cheapest for $180 ($180) if you'd stay in india, it's the best value for the price in India."
634,i stayed at this hotel on the 19th Dec for 2 nights and we had booked 2 rooms. we got complimentary airport pick up which was great. the location is great for all the tourist sights.
635,this hotel is on the same area of others which look more economic like the Royal Holidays and the Hotel Classic but compares to other doggy places this is far above in all aspects.
636,"the rooftop terrace would be nice if it weren't for the heavy smog of Delhi. Otherwise the food and drinks are decent and reasonably priced.Stayed there for a night, just before flying back out of India."
637,it was really a good experience with my partener to stay in this hotel. the pick up was free and efficient as we arrive delhi mid night.
638,"excellent quality accommodation for the value in delhi. karol bagh is a hustling area, but nice to have quiet hotel... very friendly and helpful staff!!"
639,"indian hotels are not of the quality you find elsewhere in india. the room was of a relatively nice size, but it would have gotten 1 star anywhere else. there were very big cracks in the walls and the bathroom was very shabby, the bath was cracked."
640,"the hotel is well priced, conveniently located near the Metro line (Karol Bag stop), provides airport pickup and drop off, rooms are modern, clean and spacious. front desk staff are helpful and friendly, food in the restaurant is convenient and tasty, and a travel service is available in lobby which can arrange driver and tours of the city. we found Pankaj, Rajesh and Ekta to be especially helpful, hospitable and would readily return on another visit."
641,"the staff is very accomodating, in particular Rajesh and Ekta on the front desk. one of its main attractions is the location, right at the heart of the maddness. Love it."
642,"we booked our first two nights at the Hotel Clark International in Delhi through Expedia. the hotel was charged £40.70 per night - a lot for India, but we wanted to ensure the first nights were comfortable. on arrival at Delhi International Airport, there was no one out there to pick us up."
643,"in Delhi you get what you pay for compared to hotel Clark's £35 per night. it isn't the most luxurious hotel in town, but it provides good facilities in a lively part of town - well worth the money!"
644,"the hotel is located in Karol Bagh and is right in the heart of things,clustered with back street markets and extremely lively. 75% of Delhi is like this. we based ourselves here for 5 nights, the rooms are clean and well maintained.if you want to see, feel and smell Delhi and thats probably why your are visist this city! then stay here."
645,"hotel collaborates with a travel agent named Haroon, who is excellent. he made various bookings for us and we found him friendly and reliable."
646,"check-in was anything but smooth despite having an explicit pre-paid reservation for two adults and two kids (6, 4) front-desk was insistent to have 600 INR/night for extra bed. breakfast was not at all impressive... yeah even taking room rates in account. bathroom standard should have been better. TV wasn't working, there is only 2-3 channels tuned in.... we never tried to tune in more nor did we complaint, to be fair."
647,"the hotel car picked us up from the airport, when we arrived at the Clark I nearly called a taxi to take us to the Imperial Hotel where I had stayed previously. we were taken up to our room, which was lovely, the bed was very comfotable with crisp clean sheets, air con cooled the room very fast and hot shower. the next day we got went up on the top floor for breakfast which had everything you could want to eat with an excellent view."
648,"clean, smallish but well-kept room (with noisy a/c) friendly and helpful staff. the area is noisy and colorful, which we rather enjoyed. no bad surprises. recommended."
649,the staff at the hotel were very helpful; the rooms were great and the breakfast second to none. if we needed any help with minor things that can usually go wrong on holiday we found that they had a winning partnership with Abyss Tours which many other car operators must envy in Old Delhi.
650,"the major problem this hotel has is their association with Abyss Travel...they are a joke, so see through makes you laugh. all the old tricks...obvious plants lies, lies lies. it's shame that an 'could be good hotel&quot; has to associate its self with, and promote, Abiya Travel. please don't take us for fools."
651,"the hotel is right in the &quot;horn honking' center of things. my room was small but clean and comfortable. the staff were all very kind. there was an internet snafu when I first arrived, but the manager stayed with the problem until he got it fixed and I could get online."
652,free breakfast buffet was great with a mix of local and american food. you may need to use ear plugs at night because of dogs barking and autos honking.
653,"a really recommendable, clean, friendly hotel with all mod cons (inc wi fi) by Indian standards it's very fairly priced too, so book well in advance to be sure of getting."
654,"the front desk staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. they were very happy to assist in arranging drivers, tours or train travel at competitive prices."
655,"efficient pick-up from airport even though plane was delayed. Handy for Metro.. good value hotel. included breakfast was good, and Nepali &quot;head 'head' waiter very friendly. also minibar with reasonably priced drinks, including water, which is useful if you have just arrived from the airport."
656,"stayed on two occasions in Jan. one night at first then 3 nights after a 6 day train journey. the rooms were clean,the bathrooms had bath, shower, all very clean and mini-bar &amp; air con,TV and free internet connection. there was some traffic noise but unavoidable in so busy city and no fault of the hotel."
657,"our rooms were spotlessly cleaned each day, bed linen was changed daily, hot water was plentiful. staff were extremely friendly, courteous and helpful. restaurant facilities and breakfast was very good. Room service excellent."
658,"we stayed at the Clark Hotel in July, 2007. My husband is Indian, but not from Delhi. the hotel was clean, with good airconditioning (except during the daily power cuts) the morning breakfast buffet was good, and toast was available for picky eaters (like my children)"
659,"we had no problems with the water, hot water all the time. the outside of the hotel was dirty and would not like to have walked outside on my own but that is the case all over Delhi. we stayed there for 2 weeks and if I can remember it went out twice to come back on in 5mins or less."
660,"the hotel was on the 2nd floor and we could hear the vehicles passing by, horns beeping, people's voices, and others. we had a portable heater in our room and it wasn't working, so we phoned the reception to replace it. they did...with another non-working unit."
661,"good hotel in Delhi, offered free airport pickup. great breakfast included in room price. room had a modern feel. good breakfast includes free shuttle bus to the hotel."
662,"the reception was transformed in the space of 24hrs - no mucking about! and it really didn't affect us just added to the adventures of India. we were picked up as promised from the airport which I highly recommend, the room was excellent (we chose to stay in one of the suites) the travel guide sorted us out for our private car trips around Delhi, Taj Mahal and then onto Japiur.Food here is excellent so we ate here on both evenings!"
663,"the hotel travel agent is dodgy and tried to make me go to Kashmir. but the internet was free. the service was very mixed. some people were helpful, others were downright rude, especially the man who asked me to pay extra for the taxi. I would recommend this place ONLY to budget travellers."
664,"the hotel allowed us a room at 1/3 of the normal rate. the room was amazing, all European amenities, tandoori platter for rs350, enough for two people. if you stay at this hotel you wont be disappointed."
665,teacher who went with colleague and 6 students on a trip to India. we spend our very first night in the Clark and this was the best introduction to india. the rooms were large with high ceilings and the latest in equipment and bathroom convenience... we had everything down to the bathroom slippers.
666,the hotel is literally a 30 second walk from Karol Bagh market which is great fun. you will get beggars in this area but throughout India is shame as there are so many homeless children. try and get as much as possible as you wil get harrased.
667,"we were in Delhi for the VIV India Exhibition at the Pragati Maidan, cost was a consideration when I chose the Clark International but we felt we had excellent value for money. the rooftop restaurant is very good, the food is excellent and although the hotel doesn't have any bar you can get beer with your meal."
668,"very clean and functional room (401), helpful staff. they agreed without problem to replace the free airport pickup which we didn't need by an airport drop-off early morning."
669,"the hotel is located in Asia's biggest shopping area, Karol Bagh. the ultra-modern Delhi Metro station is 5 minutes from the stayed. you can get to Delhi commercial and business center, Connaught Place, in just a few minutes more."
670,stayed in this hotel 3 nights Oct 07. transfer from airport good as we were 90 mins late the driver waited for us. no view blacked out widow ( a concrete wall behind)
671,"we hit the Clark International Hotel after 3 weeks in Bangalore and a couple of days in Udaipur. we booked through Otel.com, and paid online for an Executive room, one up from the normal room type, but when we checked in we got given the most basic crummy room which had been painted that morning (paint still wet to touch)"
672,"hotel was ok, was being decorated so constant smell of turps. no window which I found a bit weird. breakfast was good on top floor restaurant, staff generally helpful."
673,"booked via Expedia 3 weeks prior to stay, included in room price ($100 AUD) was airport pick-up. on arrival day had to email hotel to make sure they were going to pick us up (they were not bothered)"
674,"we opted for the most expensive room on the property, which was around US$125 per night. the hotel is located in a noisy and busy area, and to be honest, the staff were very friendly and the other hotel guests we chatted with in the lobby loved the place."
675,"a slew of hotels in the $30 range and $300 range would fit right into the middle. rooms are noisy, &quot;India Clean"" (sort of scruffy) and not worth more than $40. it seems the hotel is advertising on places like Expedia looking for people shopping by price - and trusting that you get what you pay for."
676,"my flight was 4 hours late and I had no idea what to expect. a huge wave of relief washed over me when I found my name being held up by an open face at the front of the overwhelming crowd. the hotel’s choice of tour agency to help me plan the rest of my journey to Rajasthan, Kashmir and Daramshala was outstanding."
677,"the staff is very courteous and helpful.2 the rooms are clean and when you request extra towels or sheets, they are provided promptly.4. the hotel is centrally located and one can easily access major tourist attractions."
678,"based on reviews on TripAdvisor, we settled on the Clark Intl. the hotel staff showed up at the airport as promised for the complimentary pickup. they come in an Indica (small car) so if you are a large family with luggage cal them and let them know in advance."
679,the hotel is centrally located in the Karol bagh area and close to Metro station. the facilities are clean and maintained reasonaby well - the complementary breakfast is good!
680,"the hotel was able to accommodate us immediately, which after a long journey was greatly appreciated. the room was basic but spotlessly clean with an air cooler (rather that air conditioning) which was noisy but apply drowned out the street noise below.as anticipated we were offered trips, booked through the hotels' travel agency, but when we declined their offer there was no 'hard sell'"
681,"my pal and I had a terrific room in an not-so-full hotel for an off-season price. our two-bed room was very clean, we had air conditioning, fridge, ceiling fan, cable TV, nice bathroom, and very nice staff happy to help."
682,"the hotel is close to a local night market and only five minutes from the Karol Bagh metro. he lied about the seat availabilty, luring us to his expensive car rides. check with ABC (?) travels, which is on the corner of the hotels block."
683,"the hotel had over-booked itself and were abruptly ushered round the corner to a much lower standard hotel. we can only review it on the basis of the accomodaiton they supplied us with: the rooms were dull and not clean (a thick layer of dust covered most the furniture); the bathroom consisted of 'a shower, an overflowing toilet and bucket; the ceiling was covered with small flies and the room was noisy (children running around and constant unidentified dripping in each"
684,the hotel is a 5 minutes (may be 3) walk and the metro goes directly to Connaught place. the staff is very welcoming and help for finding places where you want to go.
685,rooms on both occations were small but rather clean with good bed linen. bathrooms came with working but primitive showers and toilets. good towels provided and they even had toiletries. neighborhood is an extremly busy bazaar area with traffic that drives you crazy.
686,"the hotel Clark International itself was nice, but was on a narrow side street in an older part of town. the airport was over an hour late, and the driver tried to hustle me to travel agency - but we needed time to rest because my traveling companion wasn't feeling well from the flight. he took me one minute's walk to Indian Tribal Tours (see my review in Delhi info). the dining room is on the top-5th-floor, although the very old elevator only goes to the fourth floor, so it'"
687,"the hotel was noisy between 7am- 7pm because of the market, but you felt like you were in India and not a sterile 5* hotel."
688,the hotel took care of all our transportation and tour arrangements from the moment we landed to our departure. the tours were good and the pickup is handy.
689,"the hotel is located in the odd shopping district of Delhi with small streets and shops, be prepared for noise, dust, disorganised telephone lines, stray dogs and endless dust."
690,the hotel clark is three star amenities but they have some five star facilities. i got pick-up on time as they promised. food was really good. staff was very friendly. and one of the best interesting thing is free wi-fi.
691,the hotel staff were efficient at arranging taxis and giving advice on other transport/tourist issues. the airport pick-up makes even more sense in that you can get a grip on the geography of the place before you venture out.
692,"a few words for the hotel - it is situated near Khan Road (Ghaffar market) and honestly it's very busy area, dirt, small shops, street vendors, ugly buildings. some of the other hotels in the area are OK, like Clark International, and good hotels, which I later saw."
693,"Infrastructure - excellent.Room &amp; Toilet. Spic n span, clean at the corners, pleasant colors, cleanliness 'n comfortable bed' and clean linen and towels, well stocked mini fridge.Staff: Extremely friendly, cooperative and supportive.Travel support: very good with in-house cars and drivers. airport transfer is included.Location: centrally located. good for shopping. metro station is close by.suggestion: Keep tissue boxes in the rooms.Downside"
694,staff very helpful and check in/out was very smooth.Rooms were fine - probably worth going for one up from the standard so you are higher up and away from street noise. there is also a local market one road down that starts 5-ish until late (except Mondays)
695,"the hotel was good, Rooms were clean with clean cloth covers. the room was clean and the staff were very nice. a nice stay! the rooms were nice and clean."
696,I had a nice stay in the hotel with my wife. homly &amp;s clean environment with prompt service was great. value for the money.Staff was kind and helpful.
697,"staff were helpful, area was dodgy.. staff was helpful and helpful. location was a good place to crash.."
698,room service was good if you put some money for the house keeping. price they charge for rooms is again too high for what you want to get. management should be ashamed of them.
699,we travelled Delhi in group tour of india of Delhi Agra Jaipur Jaiselmer. hotel Classic is nice clean hotel with good facilities. we were served well by smiling staff. Hotel is near metro station will lift which in useful for old person like us.
700,hotel Classic is Classic in all means. I was planning to cancel my trip to India due to disturbances in India. Owner Jitendra Chadda helped me on email and assured that he will take care of us.
701,I have been visiting india's cities for last 2Months. this hotel has been most comfortable and memorable experience. i am visiting the cities of india for the last two month s. the hotel is a very comfortable stay in the city of london..
702,i booked the hotel on internet after seeing good reviews but on my arrival uncleaned room given to me. when I request the front desk they tell me to wait for 2 hours but after that they shift my room and again there was same problem. but at last they solve the problem - over all experience was bad the room service was not good.the front manager was polite and good but service wasn zero.
703,"the hotel is in the middle of a slightly quieter surburban district. it is the easiest, cheapest, least hassle method of getting round to the nearest metro station, which for Westerners is most convenient for westerners. the metro being so close was perfect. although being separated (boys in one line, girls in another) for X-ray scanning prior to embarking everytime was certainly an interesting method that I doubt passengers would tolerate on the Tube."
704,we had beed reffered by friends who visited last year. good clean budget hotel in market area Koral Bugh was a good place to stay in the city of slam. stayed at good Clean Budget Hotel in Market area. it was very nice experience. staff very friendly.
705,"the hotel was clean comfortable beds and occationally hot water. the staff are a real jolly gang and couldn't do enough to help us, they booked local taxi to take us round Delhi for the day and this is probably the best way to see most things in Delhi."
706,hotel was refered to us through common friend. but before placing booking on Expedia we foud it very satifactory. we were picked up from Airport on request to hotel and were given room on 3rd floor as requested in mail.
707,we stayed here for just one night prior to returning home. the whole appearance is shabby however we were not prepared for the rude awakening by the bed bugs...very large bed bug bugs. on complaining at the front desk they brought up a bug spray and 'clean' bedding which in fact looked even dirtier. no breakfast is included and to be honest I'd really have my doubts on the standard of hygiene in food preperation...therefore we did not call for any room service.Its not 
708,"the location is very convenient for the metro. there's an internet terminal in the lobby and wi-fi, and a mini-bar in front of the hotel. the staff is fabulous, always eager to help and friendly I needed an Indian SIM card for my cell phone."
709,"we phoned to ask for clean sheets but the sheets the staff brought up were worse than the ones already on the bed. they went through several sets of sheets looking for cleaner ones but found them all in a similar state with blood stains, greese spots and/or holes. for IRs 2811 (approximately US $60.00)"
710,"the hotel picked us up from the airport, saving a huge amount of time &amp; hassle. the next morning we found that we were in the very safe and friendly Karol Bagh."
711,the staff were fine - although sent me to get ripped off when buying a SIM card from their friend. airport pick up was good but you can do it for MUCH cheaper.
712,"the lobby is very small and the only seating area is next to the reception desk, practically blocking the main thoroughfare of the hotel. this is an inconvenience, not a value add. not at all comfortable and certainly not appropriate for any more than 5-10 min use."
713,Very clean hotel in Busting Delhi. Very cheap and found same as given in reviws. staff help guide you for city vision and Jaipur - provided hot B;fast in Room very early morning!
714,our worries vanished when we arrived at hotel Classic. agent made a perfect choice as we required clean but not costly rooms. hotel was extremely clean. staff was very cheerful and replied to my queries about Agra.
715,we booked this hotel by watching reviews of the hotel. I requested airport pickup at midnight and hotel offered pickup for US$20 instead of us$25 as listed in website. they were prompted in replying and confirming. Maduu Hotel Pickup person was waiting for us in A/C Car. Room was same as shown in site. No Carpets with Wifi at Lobby-FREE. Now at Indore I called hotel and thanked.
716,"i spent 3 nights in this hotel.Rooms were quite good, clean and not noisy. I would avoid room 104 and 107 on 1st floor, since they are next to some a/c machines and imagine are quite noisy.Staff was nice, spoke good english and helped me whenever I asked for. hotel is 5 min walking from metro station."
717,our Uncle Booked 2 Rooms for us in this good hotel. we were very afraid to travel to India due to Bombs and terrorist attacks. but for a marrige sake in Mogga(Punjab) we had to come.
718,the hotel Classic is an average mid-range hotel in the bustling Karol Bagh district. we paid 1500 rupees per night for a private AC room. the room service menu (including breakfast) is very cheap for basic but tasty food.
719,this hotel turned out to be the PERFECT starting point for our visit to India. Mr. Jitender set me up with a local travel agency to make other hotel arrangements in India. the hotel was very inexpensive by my travel standards as I am used to paying $100 to $200 per night.
720,"train,flight reservation can be made thru this hotel and the most important thing, u can chat and get informations online from the staff. the hotel staff are very helpful,especially the manager. train and flight reservation is a great location near the metro station. good location, close to metro stations. i's the train train station is near stt.."
721,"this is an inexpensive hotel in a very crowded neighborhood that will probably be very foreign and confusing to most westerners. I stayed here for two nights upon arriving in india, and while the hotel itself is fine, above average value by Indian standards, I would advise staying at an Western hotel for 'a couple of days upon arrival'"
722,"we stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our holiday in india. the first part in a room and the second in an suite was large, clean and quiet - the staff were courteous, obliging and quietly efficient!"
723,hotel has the best service you could want. they made us feel right at home. all of the staff were very respectful and greeted us with a welcoming smile.
724,"this was the one decent place we stayed in in india and it made a world of difference. good service and not that expensive though not sure how much we paid. its not the best value for money we have had but worth spending up for. I have now few hours to linger at Delhi Airport, so thought of posting review instead of crushing down in rush at counters."
725,"the service, facilities and management is uncomarable to any 3* hotel anywhere. they kept person waiting at Airport even our flight was late almost 3hours and they didn't charge extra penny for such delay. we are here blessed with Free Wi Fi with compliments of management. Owner /Boss?? is wonderful guy assisting our local trips with detailed maps- that too complimentry!!!!. staff here is attentive to our calls and swing into action whenever required. Location is marvelousl- in busy busy market. Pollution"
726,"I booked this hotel for 2 nights after having seen some positive reviews on Trip Advisor. subsequently a couple of very poor reviews had been posted, one of which suggested that guests were somehow induced to write good reviews. it was therefore with some trepidation that I decided to stick with my original reservation, and was too late to cancel anyway. the pre-booked transfer from the airport could not have been smoother, especially given that my flight was over 2 hours late arriving."
727,"i always make my customers stay there and all appreciate the hotel. ideally located,excellent service,warm staff and excellent staff. excellent service and a great location to close close to all the utss and the city."
728,"this hotel is really OK nothing exciting but clean and the stuff was very friendly and helpful. it is situated right in the centre, which is good as well."
729,"we often find hotels on TripAdvisor, and we will continue to try. if anything, it was worth much less than the $50 a night we paid. the rooms were not clean. we had to ask for towels. three or four people hung around asking for tips. 3 guys carried up two bags with their hands out the whole time."
730,"we booked online via a 3rd party site and were sold an 'room + breakfast&quot; option. they don't have their own kitchen or dining room, nor do they offer any kind of breakfast with the room. the building is fairly old and the elevator tiny, the rooms old fashioned. it's no worse than many places I've stayed in NYC, Rome and elsewhere of the same vintage."
731,"after reading positive reviews on tripadvisor.com, I've decided to book a 4 night stay at this hotel. one of our Indian colleagues went upstairs with us, on the night of the first day, and we moved to Sri Nanak Continental, which is considered to be ok/nice for an average middle class family in India. if you can, avoid Karol Bagh too."
732,"above average compared to other New Delhi moderately priced hotels. if possible, call direct to book--much cheaper. everything worked; A/C, TV, fan, hot water. asked for and received fresh towels when necessary. Tip everyone that helped you during your stay on the way out."
733,the metro was very close and easy to use. the rooms were clean and the front desk staff spoke English. this was a good hotel (with air conditioning and back up generator).
734,"this is a decent hotel in the heart of the shopping district. we stayed at this hotel for several days on two separate occassions, and the third floor rooms are much nicer and quieter. for the price, it's about the best you can find in Delhi."
735,"myself and 3 other friends stayed at the Dee Marks for 2 nights. the hotel was dimly lit and seemed like no one was there, but the doorman was hovering expecting a tip from bringing us fresh towels, to ice to room service. breakfast was very dissapointing. bread, fruit...and can order eggs through the waiter."
736,"this hotel was selected by me &amp; my friends on certain aspects, like reasonable rate package. but if we come on room package what hotel is providing on other aspects, then it was upsetting as many things was not in working as I have seen on net like swimming pool, WIFI complementary, aurvidic message,etc."
737,"the hotel is good, the rooms are clean, spacious, value for money. they have individual air-con, a good TV, and the bed is comfy. but it's let down by petty things, like associated with the staff.they advertise Wi-Fi, but you find out you have to pay for it!"
738,i booked the super deluxe suite with them on the phone at a price of £550 for 5 nights. after some arguing she reluctantly wanted back to my room he found brochure outlining rooms in which the hotel was equivelant to the suite. at rates to go the prices are confirmed and the manager should honour it as confirmed.
739,"a new, modern hotel inside, we didn’t get to see the grounds since we got there late in the day. the folks who checked us in were professional and assured us if we were able to take the taxi to the airport the next morning was included in our price of the room."
740,"I was in hotel Ajanta the sister concern of this hotel for 3 days on work. I checked out, made a trip to Agra and returned to the hotel."
741,"the website is misleading and the place is disgusting. there was actual blood on the walls of the bathroom and building is falling apart. the management will lie to you and rip you off. a terrible experience. this is an absolutely disgusted experience, if you stay here. do not stay there. The website lies lies and it's slam. it is the worst thing you want to stay in the world. you don't want staying here - the site is dreadful and you should stay stay."
742,the hotel is nothing like the photos you see (most of these are actually of the adjoining Ajanta Hotel which appears to have some kind of partnership going with the Delhi City Centre hotel) the room whilst 'cleaned' was uncomfortable in that the sheets and towels were grey and so threadbare there were holes in them.
743,the staff helped me understand where to go and what to see. my friends stayed in ajanta hotel and we would all walk to Connaught Place to eat Indian spicy 'chat'
744,"the staff charge things you haven't consumed, and for that price you can go to a REAL HOTEL. the government would close it for obvious reasons, they cheat everytime they can, you will be robbed!"
745,"we stayed at this hotel with our 3 children in the Family room. they asked us to go to our room without them but we refused and finally they brought them back.the room itself was ok, but not clean, especially the sheets which were changed and changed.but there were apparently no sheets without rips or stains - so we just put up with ripped sheets!"
746,"the photos on the website are of the Ajanta (which look quite reasonable), not the Hotel Delhi Centre and you will find out why. the hotel is cheap and cheerful, but this is not even that good."
747,i was on a business trip to Delhi and fortunately I had the privilege to book the hotel of my choice. luckily my destiny took me me to this hotel and it's not an three star hotel pls don't get misguided and secondly its the place you are destined to deserve the worst possible respect&quot;
748,"Hello,Escort girl entered by the back door with her client, customer of the hotel. although they were discreet, they weren't hiding. this hotel is probably not to recommend for family."
749,my daughter and I had booked in advance 5 nights at this hotel. the hotel is operated by the Ajanta Hotel and is located behind the ajantoa hotel. breakfast is also served at the Hotel. it advertised being adjacent the train station.
750,"the room was smaller than expected and not especially clean. the staff was friendly, spoke good English, and was helpful. we were disappointed that the &quot;free wifi' that was supposed to be included was non-existent."
751,staff at this hotel make it a great place to stay. trip to delhi would not have been nearly as good if we hadn't had staff to guide us. the room met my expectations and the breakfast was good.
752,"I stayed at this hotel 2 nights, I think the location is great to go to Delhi station, metro, Connaught place. I felt the price is a bit expensive with total.and this area - Pahar Ganji, Main bazar are very busy so if not, you will enjoy your stay."
753,"brand new hotel,picked us up from the airport gave us a nice hot meal at 3 am at night. hotel staff spent enuf time to answer my questions and have recomended them to my organisation."
754,"this is a super choice for the budget traveller, close to Connaught Place and Old Delhi. much better than many other cheap places opposite the railway station."
755,"for the price I paid, I got exactly what I wanted - clean, comfortable and welcoming place to stay in Delhi! the staff was extremely helpful and go out of their way to serve all your needs. the room was good size, freshly painted with clean sheets etc."
756,the pictures on the website are misleading. the airport pickup was a plus. we were disappointed with this hotel.we should have researched it better.
757,we booked this hotel from the airport through lastminute.com and reluctant to leave the taxi upon arrival (basically a very busy commercial street!). greeted by friendly doorman who took us to reception and from there on the experience was great.
758,"the hotel is very comfortable compared to the hotels in that locality, seriously. stayed in express 66 for the first time in delhi for 3 nights got one night free and also paid $45 per night though."
759,"we were so unhappy with this hotel, when we saw mouse in our room we all are scared and all jerk staff start smiling. Slept there one night because we had no choice. Coughed most of the night due to the smoke-embedded room. eyes were on fire for a full 24 hours after checking out. even the guy at the front desk thought it was horrible."
760,"we reached Delhi by Rajdhani express in the evening from a hectic tour in calcutta. we contacted the hotel people on telephone,and booked one executive room, and booked an executive suite, we arrived by cab and we were offered welcome drink (Coke). the staff was very humble and polite and always ready to help."
761,we reached delhi at about 10.30 pm. we were exausted as we came out of te airport the pickup cab was waiting for us as promised by the Hotel - it took 35 min to reach the hotel from the airport a guy was standing there to welcome us with the refreshing drink. the executive room was in every way very comfotable at VERY LOW PRICE according to my budget.we ordered for Indian food and it came in approx. 25 min.
762,I travelled to delhi for business purpose and was looking for some hotel near to pahar ganj &amp; found Express 66.
763,"good service friendly staff at front office, rooms were clean and were informed that these were recently renovated. looked better than the ones on the website quite surprising. use of jazzy wallpaper's and wooden paneling not bad...."
764,the 3 night stay was our final leg of a month travelling around india. it is located on the main road home to the timber and timber industry which is in use 24 hours so if you are light sleeper like me then not ideal. there is no restaurant and you have to order breakfast (which was included in our package) and any other food via room service is then brought to your room.
765,"hotel suites for local to stay between railway travel - new Delhi railway station is in 500 meters. you cant open windows both because of dust, smog and noise. WiFi doesn't work. we even ate there, no stomach problems."
766,we stayed at Express66 for 3 nights. the hotel was clean and represented excellent value for money in Delhi. rooms differed from photos that we had seen but rooms are as they appear on the website. hotel isn't on best street but at least it's not in the heart of busy/noisy Paharganj. breakfast included breakfast but there is no restaurant so this had to be taken in a room which is not ideal. Overall we would recommend this hotel.
767,the hotel rooms are spacious &amp; elegantly designed. the best part is that everything in the room was in perfecty working condition which we didn't find in any other hotel in India.
768,the hotel entry looked like an ugly storage buiding with nothing nice. when we entered the room many details were wrong firstly we tried to swich on the TV it didn t work (no conectors). when i told to the staff they send one guy whom after looking the conctor he went away and never came back with solution.
769,the hotel is in a very shabby part of the town. it is based on its high review on TripAdvisor and its relatively low price - it's run by frauds!
770,"the hotel location is not very good, but the rooms are news, comfortable and clean. the staff is very friendly and helpful. I have a great time in Express 66."
771,"my family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Express 66. we reached Delhi very late at night on march 19th, and the hotel pickup service was at the airport on time, awaiting our arrival."
772,I stayed in Express66 not once but twice and have reservation for the third time. the rooms and bathrooms are very clean and the manager and rest of staff are helpful and their service is excellent.
773,the hotel is new and it is quite small (there are only three floors with a few rooms per floor). the rooms are very clean and the bathrooms are new.
774,"the Florence Delhi is a small chain of moderately priced, small and friendly hotels. the staff worked very hard to please. The hotel was clean and comfortable, certainly sa 3+ star."
775,hotel Florence offers picks up facility to our guest @ reasonable price. the staff received us at the airport and we were in hotel within 35 minutes.Room services were also round the clock and I felt that all staff members have very jolly and friendly nature.
776,"the breakfast on the first day of our stay consisted of scrambled eggs and toasts with jam though we expected buffet. only 4 rooms are occupied, so there is no reason to cook for a buffet, and when we asked for at least some vegetables, we were offered to pay additionally. there was no hot water at 11 o'clock at night."
777,"the hotel Florence is a comfortable place in &quot;Budget' style, conveniently located close to Delhi’s most famous shopping hub called Karol bagh."
778,"Florence is situated in the busy areas of Karol Bagh. ideally positioned2) Very very very clean3) Good Service4) Bang in Middle of the shopping areas5) Good Food in Florence as well as the locality around6) Good Rates Only Drawback : Repetitive Breakfast, the same everyday."
779,"we stayed at hotel Florence just the final night before flying back home after 2 weeks of travelling around Rajasthan. the hotel was clean and the staff very friendly, but the whole décor was rather old and stuffy...Delhi overall is very expensive compared to the rest of India, so the double room at Rs3000 was probably not bad for Delhi standards, as the room rate included a Welcome Drink and breakfast.Breakfast buffet was ok – not very big and “very Indian”, but ultimately you could also get non"
780,"the rooms are small, but well appointed and well maintained, with Mini Bars and excellent restaurant on the top floor. in a city where quality and price do not always carry the relationship that one would expect, the Hotel Florence is 'a very safe choice'"
781,a 'deluxe&quot; room with window was of decent size and cleanliness. but the view was horrifying - there were hundreds of tiny beetle-like bugs crawling around outside on the other side of the window. there was also an inconsistent supply of hot water.
782,the place is inconveniently located and an unattractive neighbourhood. it is both far from the train stations and Delhi's tourist spots. During night time it looks like a slum.
783,"the deluxe room, where I stayed for two nights, was a bit small but not cramped. it was passably clean but the smell of moth balls that were placed in different parts of the room was an assault to the senses. I also appreciated that they immediately replied to my email asking about room availability and then reservation."
784,"Incredible India staff were very helpful and went out of the way to help us. this hotel is ok, not great, but something decent for those on budget. location is in the shopping areas, althought most of Delhi is like a shopping area..."
785,the hotel is nice and new in the centre of Karol Bagh with auto rickshaws and shops all around making it easy to get around Delhi from this great centre. staff were great and will stay again next time we go.Breakfast included and choices were excellent... loved the chai (ginger tea).
786,"stayed for 2 nights on way back to Mussoorie ans. room was clean, spacious and with all basic amenities. good value for money. location is ideally suited for shopping but rather conjested and noisy; though very safe."
787,this is my 8th year at this hotel upgraded to a good quality. the food was excellant brilliantly cooked the bosses eat there so that should say it all so please GO there rajan &amp;
788,"stayed in the Good Palace for 1 night before my tour and 2 nights after tour. was pleasantly suprised, they have helpful staff who at first may seem a bit standoffish but will do anything for you if needed, and they also have great room service (some of the best food I tasted in India), and their rooms are neat and nice. i would have given it an above average rating due to good value for money but they were refurbishing the lobby during my stay and it was chaotic so it wouldnt of"
789,"our room at Hotel Good Palace was clean and decent, the walls and furniture were well maintained and the TV was functional with a basic selection of local channels."
790,the hotel is located in a noisy part of the city (central sales area) the rooms were small and poorly insulated. there was no hot water in the morning after 7:30 AM and the brakfast was at best. the staff tried to be helpful.
791,"used as part of and Intrepid Tours basic trip. it was a basic hotel with dirty, languid staff, few amenities - our air conditioner wasn ot connected and we had breakfast there and had no problems."
792,"really nice place close to metro station, helpful staff, clean and tasteful rooms. we felt really lucky to have found this place. a nice location - near the metro stations, nice staff staff and clean rooms!"
793,"this hotel is a great base for exploring Delhi and Northern India. it's only 40 rupie taxi to the train station and is located 3 blocks west of the hotel, with loads of restaurants and shops. the owner Mr.Madan will book tours and help you book train and flights. he does it at cost using Indian online travel companies."
794,we stayed a night and wanted to extend for 2 more nights but the hotel staff was very greedy and the rooms are old. we moved to other hotel.
795,"rickshaw driver didn't know where the hotel was, well Delhi has millions of hotels. hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating, even though on the ground floor the entrance was sandwiched inbetween shops, do not let that deter you. once inside it is a quiet atmosphere (ok, as quiet as Delhi can get!)."
796,taxi/rickshaws tell youthey know where it is but don't. filthy street even by Delhi’sstandards. Grim breakfast. flashy showers - ifthey worked properly!
797,"the rooms are pretty big and clean and better than a lot of hotels we've been to in european countries. the staff was always helpful, and the owner let us use the computer as much as we needed."
798,"they like only white europeans and can discriminate you beouse of your low potential to pay for tours, your cloor they can trouble you being bad to you and will give you a very bad room like dungeonon. you can be slammed for being 'bad' and letting you go if you don't want to spend the money on tours."
799,"after we checked out they kept our bags for us whilst we went sight seeing and gave us a room after to freshen up before our over night train journey to Jaiselmer. two weeks later on our return we arrived in Delhi around midday but our flight wasn't till 1am. the after check out care was fantastic, they really went the extra mile."
800,Grand Park Inn is one of the best hotels I have stayed at in india. the rooms are simple but large and clean. The room service and hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. i have tried other hotels in Delhi but keep returning to grand park inn.
801,the hotel is located in the outskirts of the Karol Bargh market close to metro and shopping. the staff had pointer to a few restaurants and ended up having some of our best Indian food we had on the trip. it felt safe at all times to walk around the neighborhood.they arranged pick up as well as transportation back to the airport for very resonable price... the owner let us use his computer for our needs!
802,"the location was initially daunting- but after afew days in India I realised this was the norm - the Karol Bagh area is actually quite good, not touristy so you don't get too much bother."
803,"the resturant is on the right hand side of the hotel and is called Sandoz. it's a receommendation to us and we are so glad we went. get the malai kofta and dal makhini. there were ants in the room, but they stayed to thier section far away from the bed."
804,the hotel did not pick us up from the airport. the rooms were very basic and at cheaper price we stayed in better rooms in Karol Bagh as wechecked out after one day. not a good choice.
805,"staff were extremely helpful and looked out for us as we were unprepared for the craziness of the city of Delhi. the rooms were spotless, the beds were very comfortable and we had no complaints whatsoever. by the end of our trip to Delhi we felt that it was safe place to stay and a refuge away from madness on the streets!!!"
806,"we needed somewhere cheap, basic with a good airport pickup all of which were satisfied. the room was basic, but had free bottled water clean sheets, towels and bathroom.the staff were very friendly and helpful even when we had to wake them up at 4.30am to check out!"
807,"air condition was not working, doors make sound while closing, salt stains in bathroom wall, life seems old too, and surrounding area is bad, economy hotel. good for few hours stay at cheap price."
808,the staff really looked after me well. the hot water was not reliable but was there 70% of the time. air conditioning likewise! Staff could not be more helpful.
809,"hotel was very clean, hotel staff pleasant and helpfull and the travel desk within the hotel is great! location is OK, although not many rickshaw drivers knew it."
810,"hotel Grand Park Inn is one of the best places to stay in Delhi. the hotel's owner, Mr. Madan Pai, arranged for Vikash to drive me to and from the wedding parties...and also to interesting sites around Delhi on the days when I had no activities planned. i can honestly say that I felt very sad to be leaving this hotel and its staff...now THAT'S a first!!"
811,"our daughter and i stayed at the hotel Grand Park Inn during our stay in central Delhi. hotel staff and management were exptremely courteous and helpful, despite being in the centre of the 'automotive&quot; trade' we found the pick up from the airport and train station very reliable and safe, with clean bathrooms, air conditioning that works clean and the food and room service were prompt and delicious."
812,the hotel is surrounded by auto shops primarily for motorcyles. the metro is not that far away but getting across the busy road to access it is an adrenaline rush... not for the faint hearted!
813,the manager makes everything possible to satisfy his guests. pick up &amp; drop off service from/to the airport is also reliable.
814,the driver was always punctual courteous and very patient! his driving skills were exceptional along with his intimate knowledge of the city. I would have no hesitation in recommending anyone who wants to experience the real Delhi its wonderful people and high level of friendly service to stay in this gem of a hotel.
815,the facilities are great as it is very close to the karol bagh market and an auto rickshaw ride away from Connought place.
816,"the hotel is convenient for the metro station, auto rickshaws and buses to travle round Delhi. the owner/manager (?) Madan was so welcoming, full of restaurant recommendations (good ones), helpful hints and couldn't do enough to help us.would recommend the Grand Park Inn to anyone wanting to stay somewhere that's not a global chain, has some Indian characteristics and wants good friendly service."
817,"I can recommend this Hotel to international tourists without hesitation. i have stayed at the Grand Park Inn for the past 5 years and have been impressed by the clean and neat and comfortable rooms as well as the efficient staff and the GM, Mr Madan Pai who has his finger on the pulse."
818,the lunch and the complementary break fast were very tasty. it had most of the things that you look in a hotel. the breakfast was excellent - it was the best hotel in the world.
819,"i had stayed in many hotels in delhi, but grand park, is extremely nice and comfortable hotel, staff is great very freindly abd specially owners are there themselves to check all our requirements, very clean place to live in....harryry live."
820,"the hotel was easy to find, as well, because of its proximity to the gigantic Hanuman statue down the road. the value was good, and as much as was provided, nothing extra was asked. I will definitely return on my next stay in Delhi."
821,"the staff were the same boys as last year and they all rememberd us. the servis and clenliness is second to none, and the organisation was excelent. we intend going to Delhi again next year - and because of the way we are treated by everyone concerned, we will be staying at the Grand Park Inn yet again."
822,it was average hotel but I am still satisfied with my stay. the only thing I did not like much was its location which is a very busy and congested lane.
823,this was between Average and Very Good (so really just Good) ac was not good though noisy and ineffective. hotel organised taxi for us for the day (recommended) but we got annoyed when he kept bringing us to places (shops) where 'he'd get commission if we bought something'
824,excellent customer service. clean and centrally located. complimentary breakfast with choice of continental or Indian menu. Friendly staff. Provision for left baggage for returning guests away on short excursions. email response within one day.
825,"location is not so good and price is too much. unnecessary huge rooms but not at all professional behaviour...and staff are terriblly poor knowledged.Stay here, if you do not have a better option."
826,all-in-all value for money. the room i stayed was clean and the food served was good. food was tasting OK.
827,"the complimentary breakfast is a simple parantha type of thing, but tasty nonetheless. if you are looking for an overnight stay without the frills of an excellent hotel, this isn't the bad place at all."
828,"itCheap is a good place to crash out in the night. clean rooms are clean, clean and value for money."
829,"a true gem of Delhi and to Mr Madan Pai and Team: I salute you! from Prinitha Dowlath and family, south africa. the 'room boys' prayed each day for their mother's recovery, and they stayed at the Grand park inn on 2 prev trips and enjoyed the service excellence and clean rooms. he also topped up my fathers mobile phone with airtime from his personal funds."
830,"we visited india for two weeks and the Grand Park Inn was our base. the trips we booked with Mr. Madan Pai were A-1 - the inn is clean and clean. we came as strangers; we left as friends. Thank you much for everything, Mr pai!"
831,the hotel is well situated for the metro &amp; local market area 5 mins walk away.Rooms (1800 rupees double)are spacious and immaculate and all staff smiley and helful.
832,the location of the hotel was not ideal for lone female travellers. the area is made up of car repair companies - therefore there are very few females to be seen within the region.
833,we were able to explore all over Delhi from our base in Karol Bagh. we had to cross over a busy intersection near the Hanuman temple to get to the metro station.
834,we had booked this hotel initialy to start our tour in india but it happened so that arrangement was cancelled and all due to terrorism that happened in that time in mumabi. when contacted the management they were so considerate and without any fuss it was dealth with sympathy and we eventualy stayed their upon return leg of the tour.
835,"the manager and staff at the Grand Park Inn were polite, helpful and friendly. the driver, malkit Singh, was always there on time to pick us up at a airport - and was very attentive to our needs and safety 'in the wake of the heart attack'"
836,"the hotel was spotless &amp; the room very pretty luxurious for Delhi standards, specially for this price range. the location was pretty good, close to 'city centre' - Connaught Place, although you will need to cross some dangerous roads to get to the metro...but that was all part of the fun of dodging traffic in India!"
837,"the first night I spent in the annexed lower-priced hotel next door - this did not make me very happy, but then the next day I could change and I liked it! the room was very big, the TV worked well and the fridge even had a generator. the hotel staff was friendly (all young males), but sometimes struggled with their English."
838,"this was our first hotel in Delhi, and we found everything apart from the breakfast and location to be very good. the location is fairly near to a metro but crossing the busy roads is required, which for some, may be tricky outside of the toursity areas where it's free for all."
839,"the hotel is in a strange part of Delhi - lots of motor shops, motor bikes etc. the markets are wonderful, people very kind and friendly everywhere it seemed and at no time did we feel threatened when in Delhi."
840,"we wanted a very clean and decent hotel during our Delhi-Agra trip. we had to call up hotel, Grand Park Inn.Got really good response for our call.we were glad to see the clean bathroom.Food was good.Felt homely, calm and safe.Room interiors were above average. management need to train the staff on communication skills."
841,the Grand Park Inn is a good clean hotel with great staff. the hotel is quite near the centre of Delhi and is very good value for money.
842,"it was almost impossible to choose a reasonable place to stay in Delhi. but this hotel was quite good after all.location - not far from CPmanager – competent (very unusual)rooms, quite big, newly renovated and literally spotless, highest mark for cleanliness!breakfast area, too small, people have to wait, rather poorroom service, very good ( if you close your eyes on some bit of cheating)"
843,"we stayed 3 nights, but our experience was terrible. a lot of noise and the staff sometimes was insistent. the sheets weren't clean. our sheets were not clean, and we were able to stay 4 nights."
844,"the Grand Park Inn is a very reasonably priced hotel in Delhi. but its location is less-than-nice, despite its proximity to the subway and the city's subway system. the management is awful. my key complaints: no driver from the airport although scheduled; (b) after day 2 (of 3), they move me to sister hotel; and (c) they give me room in the new hotel that has no out-facing window."
845,"the room rate is cheap by Delhi standards, and the hotel is clean. if you get shifted to other hotels, please do not use elevators for your safety. the area around the Grand Park Inn is not good. we got conned by a nearby optician store (Punjab Opticians) that the grand park inn owner (Mr. Madan Pai) recommended."
846,we were very impressed with our room at hotel Grand Park Inn. the bathroom had a bath and there wasn't much hot water and you had to call the reception to turn it on and that took 10 mins to heat up. but that was fine and we got used to that.
847,"the Grand Park Inn was our in our first destination New Delhi and also our fourth stop, en route to Kolkata. the hotel is really central located (just go out and take a taxi, it only takes you about 10 minutes to Connaught Place) the rooms were sparkling clean and service is immaculate, including some personal tourplanning. we will definitely stay there again."
848,"we had a great stay in this hotel. find the room and hotels is well maintained. room is large &amp; clean, and the bathroom is clean and with good hot water supply. sounds insulations can improve as we can hear dogs barking throughout the night."
849,"the hotel was originally set to stay at the Hotel Ananda. we had complimentary airport pickup - the driver was there on time and very pleasant. this was helpful having just arrived in India. the rooms here were decent, ok size and generally clean."
850,"we were originally booked to stay in the Ananda Hotel and moved to this more expensive hotel. the rooftop restaurant was ok, although we stayed for 3 nights and it was not serviced once - despite our reservation."
851,we booked in for 3 nights but started searching for a new hotel after the first day. the rooms we stayed in were ok and the bedding clean enough but there was this overwhelming bad smell that I could not take.
852,my stay in this hotel is not good because hotel are not clean and bad service. Very dirty smell in the hotel because outside of the hotels is a big dustbin where all the waste integrated but no manage it!
853,"this was my second stay at Grand Peepal. I visited Delhi in May also and the service was excellent then too. the front desk staff was very attentive to my needs and safety, especially as a single woman traveling alone."
854,I booked this Hotel through a Travel Agent (Incredible Heritage Tours) my stay here was for great. the staff was helpfull and the reception always warm welcoming!!!I was here on bussiness but also Travelled 'abit' I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ALL TRAVELLER AND ALSO THE BUSSINESS PEOPLE.
855,"this hotel is small but located near a big shopping area so I could buy foods, water, fruits and juices, etc very easily. shops and restaurants were accessible."
856,"new reception due to be ready by next January. the rooms were excellent, large, clean and well equipped. however we were in rooms which have been upgraded and, as far as we could find out approximately half of the room still require upgrading. bar area was okay but dirty from dust from construction work (probably would be closed by EHS in UK)."
857,the hotel is located in Connaught place which is the heart of Delhi. the rooms are very big &amp; spacious but not well maintained. it is situated in the central district of the Delhi. a good location is close to the city centre.
858,"rooms look old with stained walls; albeit large; should be maintained properly; may not stay their the next time they stay. not worth the rent charged; food not very good; room looks old and old, if it's worth a rent charge."
859,hotel Janpath location is good and close to connaught Place.Service is slow. front desk response is average..staff are slow and friendly.
860,the hotel was on the dirtiest list of india. it was the worst rip off of my life. paid 160 USD for one night at what was supposed to be a 4 star hotel.
861,the hotel is okay but we liked the restaurant more because of its good food and live ghajals program. it's good to be there with family and friends and enjoy the party.
862,"the staff were doing their Diwali worship in the lobby and we had to wait over 20 minutes just to check-in and get us to our room before they were done. the rooms were too narrow and uncomfortable, the wooden tiles on the floor were creaky and the AC was turned on full blast turning the room into an ice chest - the hotel staff shouted across the corridor to each other (terrible when the sound echoes ). to top is all, they have the nerve to call the Janpath a 4"
863,"a trip to Delhi to watch the 1st ODI between India-England in march 2006. Upon reaching Delhi I was transferred to hotel Janpath for my stay. the hotel was awesome and I have never experienced such incredible service before. Dinner was the best I had over there, and the accomodation was simply satisfactory."
864,i loved the way of their welcome to the guest......the facilities were good.......there is slight problem of room adjustment but it can't be mind. overall its a good experience.
865,"the hotel is located off of Janpath in a dilapidated looking side alley. the building from the outside read &quot;MAJOR DIVE'; all over it...dirty and unruly' the rooms I was shown had NO windows and while it seemed like it might be clean, my 200Rs budget hotel at Cozy Hotel in Pahar Ghanj was looking more chic, clean and safe by the minute."
866,food is good in the Sagar Rathna restaurant which provides South Indian fare but the Gulnar restaurant offers a variety of cuisines is just about okay and priced at slightly higher rates. the rooms are quite spacious but have minimal facilities and the cupboard is also small. do not expect fast billing before 12 noon and do give notice atleast 1 1/2 hours before. hotel staff are not very friendly and seem quite cold.
867,"we both agreed we had stayed in far better hotels in major european capitals for less than a quarter the price we paid here. the staff were unhelpful and the food below average, the rooms ill equipped. many rooms appear to be derelict and abandoned, or being refurbished."
868,"hotel staff showed us a room on the 4th floor. the hotel was clean and presentable, the lobby was small, not grand at all but clean, and the elevators were the old English lift type andworked well. directlyto my left was part of hotel or not, I wasn'tsure that was in the midst of construction."
869,HI This is Alam. Me and my Friend stayed in this hotel in the month of October and we found hotel is good 4 star.
870,"I booked into the Janpath for a couple of weeks because I was going to be in Delhi for work. it had nothing: no email access, no grotty bar, restaurant I didn't really try, terrible dysfunctional TV with about 2 channels and poor reception, and faulty electrics that constantly threw out sparks. the laundry service was efficient and well-done, too. and the location is obviously very good."
871,"the &quot;suite' consisted of carpet that looked original and contained more dirt than my garden. the windows didn't close properly, sucking the mildly cool air from the air conditioner right out. bathroom walls had mold, including the shower which only provided ice cold water."
872,"the Janpath would be lucky to receive two stars in any other country. the location is good, but the prices are ridiculous and the rooms are very basic. three nights cost me nearly six hundred Australian dollars. do not stay at this hotel!"
873,"we were told that we could not our first choice of hotel because it was fully booked. the agent told us that she had booked the 4 star hotel which was better than our second choice, so you can imagine our horror when we booked in at the Janpath."
874,"the hotel janpath is a government run hotel, part of the ashok group. the price was about $150 with taxes which seems to be about average for this class of hotel."
875,when we made reservations we were told this hotel was a 4 star. the rooms were dirty. no hot water at anytime. bathroom had mold everywhere. staff was rude. I didn't mind paying I just wanted to get my things and get out of there.
876,"we paid way too much for the stay we got - 4700rs/night. the room, though large, was very worn, the bed was inadequate sized, and the bathroom was as clean as can be expected from this kind of hotel, not well-maintained. we had several maintenance issues while there, but the staff was quick and effective in responding."
877,"the charges for food were like 4-5* hotels. they charged 45Rs for a cup of tea and more than 200rs/person for useless breakfast. the staff was rude, but after we had the breakfast, they said it is not."
878,"the hotel was an absolute disgrace, there was no cleansiness we stayed 1 night. they insist on payment upfront which should of got the alarm bells ringing. DO NOT STAY HERE."
879,a deperate hotel - only to be used in the crisis. not recommended to stay more than one night! no hot water at all despite the fact that the staff came up twice to fix it. be very careful before you pay the bills!
880,"pathetic, despicable, bad can't find enought negative adjectives for this hotel. rooms are like they have never been cleaned, bathrooms are as like everyone in the hotel uses one single bathroom. service very very bad. no water to drink... just plain out lousy."
881,"my experience was terrible. I called the day before to confirm our booking with Janpath. we were rudely told that there was no reservation. he was challenging me that it was not a reservation, and then his tone changed. the room was dark and noisey and for the first time we both decided to forgoe on the bath/shower."
882,we had 4 rooms with inoperable showers/tubs. the water backed up the drain under the sink and flooded the bathrooms. there was only 1 room that they would change and changed again and again. The hotel wanted payment the same day we checked in. they insisted we pool our money for all the rooms and pay at one time since they refused to change money.
883,"i was the only non-Indian on the bus, and it surely sucked. do not stay at this hotel. you don't want to waste $70/night for this crap."
884,"delhi is really hard to get a decent hotel that isn't ridiculously expensive. it's decent and clean with good size room, bed, tv and shower/bathroom."
885,"room 303 is sometimes very loud as the Kitchen of the rooftop restaurant is right above it, otherwise the area was quiet during nighttime."
886,"my client wanted to visit me but can't use my laptop here, no internet access. the telephone operator was rude and rude with him while helping him with directions. a backpacker area."
887,we chose this hotel for our over-night stay in Delhi. the place is good value for the money. it definitely needs a little polish here and there... but our bathroom was spotless! the staff was very friendly and did their best to make our stay as comfortable as possible.
888,"the hotel is down a bustlig side street. it is clean and the rooms are well apointed, nice double bed, TV and clean bathroom. AC and room fan available. I did not find any cockroaches - always reassuring!the staff are extremely freindly. Happy to help sort things out and are always on hand for assistance."
889,"the room was not the biggest I had stayed in but was clean, nicely decorated, and had everything I was promised. the food was traditional Indian food, not westernised, but excelent quality."
890,stayed at lal's Haveli at the start and end of my recent trip to India. the rooftop restaurant provides great food at cheap prices. don't be put off by the area. give this place a chance and I am sure you will find the same wonderful hospitality.
891,the staff are lovely and helpful. Would recommend but dont expect luxury when you pay peanuts. no internet or wi fi in the hotel - it is around the corner.
892,"the staff are polite and willing to serve. as the area has many hotels, it will be difficult to find a better value."
893,the area is great to wander around and so close to Connaught Place and I recieved an airport pick up with a nice driver who spoke good English. staff are courteous and friendly and the food on the roof top terrace is amazing!
894,the receptionist was very curt and said you can come and see the difference. they badly need to train their staff for a decent behaviorhelloneoo@yahoo.com.
895,"amazing locationnice and clean new roomsvery good value for moneycourteous staffwould give it 5 outta 5. great location nice and nice rooms. nice clean rooms, nice & clean room nice nice room. a great value compared to the price. the staff would give the room 5outts if it's worth the money."
896,"this hotel was much more than I expected for the price! I arranged a late night pickup and they were there and waiting. the room was large and very clean, the staff was plentiful and courteous."
897,"rickshaws are available anywhere in the city anytime of day. the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, they even let me keep my luggage there free for a week as I left and travelled west into Rajhastan. there were two other great things about this hotel: first, there was an internet cafe right behind it for 20 rupees/hour. second, almost right across from it were an awesome sweets shop called Bikaner Sweets (very clean and western in setup)."
898,"this is my first time to New Delhi. before coming to Delhi I was looking several 3 stars hotel through internet and got some places that can give enjoy time during stay in Delhi. I decided one hotel named Le Roi Hotel and check in the hotel that very clean, and nice service from the front office until the room boy."
899,"we visited hotel le Roi with friends in november 2009. we felt very nice and comfortable, we enjoyed our stay very much. I can recommend this hotel to every one who stays in Delhi. if you stay in the Delhi, you can stay here."
900,we stayed in le Roi late October 2009 and had a fantastic stay. the hotel is very clean and spacious the room does have little greatness and all in all it is an excellent apartment. what gives it such great review is the service you receive. I can quite honestly say I have never received such excellent service before.
901,"i was on a business trip earlier this month and got the chance to stay in Hotel Le Roi. I was very glad with the level of service and Facillities this hotel provides - and would ensure that for my next visit which is due in January,I will again put up in this Hotel.thanks Guys for excellent service."
902,colossal city of new Delhi was great experience to find retreat and refreshing in le Roi Hotel. atmosphere is so nice. staff was very friendly and professional. very clean hotel. hope to be back next year..
903,"I was on my business trip to Mauritius and India[ New Delhi ] in November 1st week. my all travel arrangement done by Trip Advisor. it was very comport,very clean &amp; tidy, best room service with respect."
904,"this hotel is situated in a very comfortable location,It is Less than 5 minutes walking distance from New Delhi Railway Station.Hotel rooms Speaks of Quality and Elegance."
905,"le Roi is a brand new hotel in the middle of the crowded touristic Paharganj area. it is quiet, modern, has the best soft beds we have had in India and perfect warm shower. the rooms are very very good."
906,"the hotel is very modern and hip, all the amenities a foreign traveler could want and expect. only problem I faced was slight connection error from my room to the internet. the excellent customer friendly staff worked out my internet connectivity issue &amp; has gone above and beyond to accommodate some of my last minute travel planning."
907,"it is average hotel. the roomservice is poor as they do not listen to us for older of food. i came to this hotel on recommendation of TRIPADVISER but on thecontrary it was not that good, the location is very crowded. hotel is a nice hotel with good staff and good location."
908,"new hotel &quot; le roi' is a very good hotel with exccelent accomodation, good services and an exquissite cusine. i highly recommend you to go there if you stop in new delhi and go to the u.s."
909,hotel le roi has a very central location. the pool will be soon finished in this hotel so if you come there you'll have it probably!
910,the hotel itself stands out for the others in the area being larger although still relatively small. the staff are excellent and show much eagerness to assist you with any problem. The rooms see no fall in standards from the entrance and are very modern with plenty of marble and dark wood with a slight euro/oriental theme.
911,"the staff ordered food for us from outside and charged us 3 times the price. when it came time for a shower, one EACH night we had to ask staff to turn on the hot water so we could have hot shower. our bed sheets changed twice because they were blood stained and it seemed like the sheets were never changed from the previous occupants."
912,hotel legend is a budget property with not much else to offer. it was super cheap ($39 AUD per night) but the reviews were good compared to other properties we stayed in during this recent trip.
913,"hotel legend international looked impressive on their website but was a fairly average hotel. the location was fine - walking distance to restaurants but rickshaw ride to Chandi Chowk, fort etc."
914,stayed here on three occasions during the summer with my girlfriend and extended family who were in India for a wedding. the metro also stops here so it's good for getting around the city. there is no shortage of travel guys in Delhi so shop around!
915,"our first night in india arrived at 4am after a bus crew couldnt locate hotel. friendly staff,especially on the rooftop resturant, very pleasant rooms and great location and value."
916,"teh bathrooms tend to get hot during the day so remember to close it as you leave. there are two computers available for free internet access, one wasn't working when I was there and they actually let me use theirs in their little office! one night we had bought too many beers and shared some with some of the service guys- they thought we were fantastic!"
917,"the room was cheap--20£ per night--and overall a really good budget hotel. DOWNSIDES-there were always loiterers in the lobby and on the stairs...I didnt understand that. Also, there were loiters in hte halls,outside our room...ready for our beck and call."
918,"i booked the hotel from england, before travelling to delhi, as all previous reviews had been pretty positive. booked two trible bed rooms, which have one super kink bed and a single bed, and were ensuite. the whole stay cost me around £100, that includes airport pickup and drop off at the railway station."
919,"the rooms were quite small, but they are no smaller than those in hotels in other cities elsewhere in the world. the staff were very helpful. I would recommend this hotel."
920,"'Very hard sale' by the in-hous travel agent was annoying and worth avoiding at all costs. for what we paid, it really wasn't value for money."
921,this hotel was comfortable and very easy on my budget. it is located a short walk from the new Delhi train station and Metro stop - the street is lively so you may hear some noise but I was not disturbed by it. the online booking process was easy and accurate.
922,"new Delhi train station is 5 mins walk away, and they have an excellent facility for travellers to book train tickets. the hotel gives home to a rather sleazy looking fellow who will, almost as soon as you get in, try to sell you all sorts of tours, viewing experiences and assorted malarky."
923,"we rang and told them to pick us at domestic terminal but the driver didn't show up. the travel agent tried to charge us Rs650 for the non-existent pickup - after some arguing on two occasions we didn’t pay him. room was clean enough but there was no hot water and toilet did not flush, it just sprayed water from it's pipework across the bathroom floor. good thing about the hotel is it is only a 5 minute walk to new Delhi train station."
924,"the man organising trips/travel at the front was a bit pushy but otherwise the staff were ok, not overly friendly but not rude. the room itself was very comfortable and spacious, air con and bathroom were good.Would happily stay again.Also free internet in the lobby."
925,"hotel legend is one of the most popular &quot;budget' properties in the neighborhood. the rooms were pretty much as expected although ours had no windows, and service was acceptable. we had some items stolen from our luggage there, which included a small amount of cash, I miss the money clip more than the dollars. if you eat in your room, the other option is on the rooftop which has the atmosphere of an industrial air conditioner."
926,"this was my first experience of a hotel in india. the hotel was as advertised and had hot water as I was to discover many places said they did but actually didn't, it was reasonably clean and it even had toilet paper. staff were friendly, we were able to use the Internet in the lobby whenever we wanted."
927,"this hotel is really noisy (both the city and the staff are extremely noisy) and it feels a bit overpriced. it's also 5 minutes away from the train station, so the location is great, especially if you're getting an early flight."
928,"the travel guy in the lobby is definitely shady and will change his quoted price every time you talk with him. but if you bring up a price that you got at some other travel agency, he'll definitely move on his prices. breakfast is okay, but dinner is fantastic. I chalked it up to it being India and didn't let it bother me."
929,"the Paharganj market district is one of Indias must see attractions. the hotel is satisfactory in every way, clean rooms and good service. a good budget hotel."
930,"this hotel is so close to the shops of Paharganj, all the services are nearby. the rail station and Connaught Place are just a short rickshaw ride away from the hotel - it's clean, inexpensive, and the service is great. we'd recommend it to anyone!"
931,"the hotel is located in one of the worse locations in New Delhi! there was no hot water, limited amounts of toilet paper, the TV channels kept going and the noise from outside was so bad even ear plugs could not block it out. I would not recommend the breakfast, also the guy who sells the tours was very shady, kept changing prices?"
932,"the staff english was quite limited, and even upon arrival we were asked if we had any laundry. we even had a bellboy stationed outside our room and thought he didn't understand the word of danish, privacy was limited.Roomservice came to the immidiatly (after all, sat just outside) but they usually forced their way into the room, which was very annoying."
933,"stayed at the hotel in the first week of March with my wife and 3 yr old daughter. good clean rooms, decent food, average hospitality."
934,we booked to stay at the hotel legend for 3 nights in february. no-one from hotel was at airport and we could not get through on the phone. we eventually got a taxi and when we arrived at 2am we got another gentleman who just said they were full and to come back tomorrow with no apology or explanation as too why our booking had fallen through.
935,"the staff were helpful although sometimes pestered a little and although there is no restaurant as such the food is very good. the rooms are clean and spacious and have comfortable beds, tv and some have fridge."
936,"compared to others in this price range (1200-1500 Rs) the rooms are well furnished (very good mattresses), clean and safe (sturdy doors with good locks)."
937,"the Legend Hotel was booked for our first few nights in intimidating India. it's a little higher than our usual budget, but having an comfortable place to get over jet lag was worth it. the street is still pretty busy but the interior of the hotel was very nice."
938,"the international legend is a good choice because for 3000 rs you can find better place in that area. the hotel is very close to railway station but the area looks like Berlin after WWII. many people, very dirty streets."
939,"hotel booked through email. rate of 2250rs incl tax and breakfast for a super deluxe. the room itself dont quite feel like super-deluxe, but the window was tiny and gave no view at all."
940,the room was pretty clean and the staff were very helpful - there was always someone available to help out. on both visits we had to ask for the air con and hot water to be switched on.
941,"the hotel is very clean, the staff are very polite and nothing is too much trouble. the main point is that it is quiet, despite being in the middle of mad Delhi!"
942,"I and my wife stayed at hotel Legend, New Delhi for 3 nights in september. the room given to us was on 3rd floor and was clean and comfortable.the interiors of the hotel are real good (specially their 1st floor lobby)"
943,"the hotel price in Delhi is very expensive according to their level. the only problem is Wifi, there is no wifi, I have to go to the lobby to use Internet."
944,"i'd tried to book hotel ajanta close to hotel legend, but it was booked up. had room on the top floor, clean, spacious and quiet."
945,the hotel is not very clean. staff is ok. Near airport. dining room. but I would suggest finding a 3 star hotel. an Indian friend made the reservation for our departure next am. Wished he would have gone for better place.
946,"this hotel is very practically situated near the airports, so if you have an early flight (domestic or international), you won't have too much trouble. the rooms are quite spacious and fairly well equipped, and can be quite noisy at night due to the traffic on the highway just outside the hotel."
947,"I booked this hotel through Makemytrip. it was a nice hotel, and specially recommended for people travelling through airlines - it is close to both airports (Domestic &amp; International)."
948,"a total of 4 reviews, 2 of them mentioned filthy sheets/stains. it was the true reason why I chose this hotel, which was so close to the dehli airport, that we only had to stay in the hotel for several hours."
949,"hot water in bathroom sink began to work, but not in shower so we had to transfer water to shower to take ladle shower. this is a terrible hotel--you would be better off at some hostels."
950,"the hotel is pretty good located if you have an early morning flight. the rooms are well-sized, the beds ok, but staying their in the winter is extremely cold and draughty (no heater)."
951,"the hotel is on a highway that runs along the airport, but is about an 8-minute ride from/to the terminal. the first room didn't have the hot water it was supposed to have, and staff promptly upgraded me from Deluxe to Suite, for no extra charge."
952,"the room was big, clean by Indian standards, and there was hot water in the shower. a taxi to central New Delhi should only cost about 200 rupees from here - if you are arriving or departing from the airport at an inconvenient hour. the reception staff were friendly and welcoming even during the night when we arrived, but beware of pre-paid taxi fares."
953,three agressive bell boys insisted on helping with our two bags upon jet-lagged arrival and all wanting tips. had trouble with AC. Breakfast adequate. Desk staff helpful. Don't stay here unless you have to. Not 'a good experience'
954,"the hotel is situated on a good location, not far from anything if you have driver. the staff was very helpful and friendly! we also got to know hotel owner mr. Naresh (Pintoo) when we wanted to book train tickets for Agra. he advises and organizes 13 day trip through Rajasthan with car, driver, hotels, and guides in some of the cities."
955,the hotel Madonna is clean the staff is somewhat efficiant and they all want to make your stay as happy as possible. it is highly recommended for a comfortable and easy stay in New Dehli!
956,direct communication with the owner wich can tell you a lot about india. if wanted he can arrange for fixed prices day trips and you'll be treated like his guest all the way.
957,"my wife and I stayed at the hotel Madonna on three separate occasions while traveling between other cities in India. we really liked the night manager, Tripathi and our taxi driver, Kashmira. they were fantastic and generous and made our stay a very nice one."
958,"Found staff and owner, Mr Naresh, to be very helpful and really enjoyed the tour organised by the hotel to Agra and Jaipur. will definitely recommend."
959,stayed for 2 nights whilst we did the taj and delhi sightseeingthe hotel arranged for our pick up at airport everything went very smoothlywe did tours thro the hotel and they were worth every penny driver was excellentonly problem not many places to eat around.
960,"Mr. Naresh provided us excellent services, being very professional and a nice human being making us feel like at home. he was able to provide us great services and was very helpful and made us look like home."
961,this hotel was a good clean hotel right in good location to the main attractions of Dehli. the staff were brilliant and very helpful and polite.
962,"the hotel car and driver (complimentary) was waiting for us at the airport complete with sign. Naresh also arranged the same driver for our tours of Delhi, and Agra over the next two days."
963,"when we arrived they told us to go here so we got cab and arrived at the hotel. they said were out of triples sp we will upgrade you to a suite, so the room was so-so, with hot showers, refrigerator and refrigerator. at night there were street noise and one mourning outside our hotel there was an parade at 6 p.m."
964,the hotel was comfortable and clean and provided everything we needed including a brilliant sightseeing tour of dehli and then the key highlights of Rajasthan. the staff were the best and had an warm personnality.again this was awesome so much so we stayed there once we returned from our Rajasthan tour.
965,the hotel is ideally situated to travel in and around Delhi as well as a good departure point that does not get too involved in the hustle and bustle of the traffic congestions.
966,"the hotel was clean and quiet, but what we liked most about the place was the staff, who were not only helpful but genuinely friendly. the owner, Mr. Naresh Bhattia, was also able to provide advice and services for travel in his part of the country, which for us meant Agra, Jaipur and Pushkar."
967,"the hotel was nice and clean. the services were excellent. people were very helpful, when you need something the were always there.the only thing need to be upgraded is the shower."
968,"the hotel Madonna is in my experience a good choice, with very helpful and friendly staff. this is the second time I have stayed here, and the manager even has spare GSM card for emergency guest use, if the connection fail (which it did not do during my six day stay)."
969,"we booked our stay at Hotel Madonna through Expedia, prior to consulting a print travel guide on India. the hotel staff were unable to get their computer running Windows 95 to work--they just kept checking the cables and turning it off and on. there are much better places to stay in Delhi."
970,the hotel madonna has been a customer since last three years. it was the first time that I visted india I was not familiar with india. i was along with my wife and were in India for her treatment purpose. the owner was alwayse asking if we need his help in travel inside India.
971,"we stayed in hotel Madonna for the major part of our stay in India. in between, we made a trip to Jaipur and Agra organised by the hotel. hotel looks very good, nice clean rooms and good facilities. breakfast at any time, and close to the metro and central places in Delhi."
972,"we were warmly greeted at the airport,by hotel driver no charge.,Taken directly to hotel. escorted by the bellman [Sanjay] to my room which was immaculate and very clean with all western amenities including A.C. staff was very accomodating any requests I had were fufilled,even when I left hotel I was offered a hotel business card, Staff was always concerned and wanted to make sure I always knew the way back."
973,"we had contacted the hotel a few days before, that we would need to be picked up from the train station at 10.30pm. hotel told us to get any taxi and they would cover the cost of the taxi - but the manager who was very rude tried to argue with taxi driver and try to pay us the same day when wanting to check out. by now all we wanted to do was go to bed. when we finally got to the room it was horrible!!! Large ants all over the floor, dirty bathroom, no towels and rubbish"
974,"a colleague recommended me hotel Madonna and was very happy with the choice. the hotel arranged the accommodation, airport transfer, and tour programme with personal driver, tour guide and travel guide."
975,"rooms were dirty, staff was unfriendly. rooms weren't clean and dirty. room was dirty and clean. staff were un friendly."
976,"the rooms have carpet which is filthy and carpet anywhere in India is a bad idea. staff were friendly enough, breakfast staff had very limited english and the breakfast was very average."
977,was picked up at the airport and taken to the hotel...delightful!!Check-in was quick and easy. the owner was in thelobby..a nice gentleman. he made arrangements fora car to take us to Agra.
978,"hotel Madonna in Delhi was very convenient to all Delhi landmarks. hotel staff were great, literally waited on us hand and foot and arranged all our trips, which included Agra and Delhi sights. the owner send us two boxes of biscuits each, that was six boxes for three people, i was impressed!"
979,"arrived in middle of night by taxi, very expensive rider, operator did not have reservation, put us up in room, dirtY, smelly, slept on top of bed. had help with luggage, but wouldn't leave until tipped well! supplies were limited to a little toilet paper, no soap, one wet towel.checked out early, they do not take credit cards...what we were told, only cash...I paid $60 and friend paid $100 only bills we had on hand."
980,"the staying was nice; it was a clean place. but especially, Naresh, the owner, made our days in Delhi 'a safe, really nice trip'"
981,"the Madonna hotel was reserved for us by a travel agent, reputedly an 3* hotel. we arrived late at night (2am) and there were thankfully people awake. two guys brought our bags up, and stayed in the room until they tipped."
982,"i've stayed in 8 hotels here at the budget level, and TripAdvisor was useless. the madonna staff was always trying to discourage you from talking to others about your travel needs. a sweage smell and the constant din from the street are the two things to be wary of in delhi hotel room."
983,"stay at the hotel Madonna, ideal location to see the real Delhi. clean and safe hotel by Delhi standards and the food was acceptable. a tip of less than 100 rupees is probably more than enough for carrying your bags to the room."
984,a decent Delhi hotel near the metro (5-10 minute walk) so accessible to much of the city. the staff was helpful but not friendly. also not particularly attentive. breakfasts were good and the one dinner I had was very good.
985,the rooms were very comfortable and service excellent. we were also able to avail ourselves of the excellent service of Naresh Bhatia in organising a driver toshow us the sights of Delhi and tour of Agra and Rajasthan for 12 days.
986,"our first and final 2 nights were spent in Delhi were we stayed at the hotel Madonna. despite being warned it would be difficult to find good hotels in the country, we struggled for an option of hotels within our price range. at about 2am we were warmly welcomed by the night manager and 2 people assisted with our bags."
987,"we recently stayed at this hotel for 4 seperate nights. the hotel room itself seemed clean and bug free, although the sheets were very stained. both toilet paper and towels were both in shortsupply, with just one handtowel supplied (on one occassion this clearly hadn't been changed as it was dirty and wet!)"
988,"the hotel in general is clean, the restaurant underground does have an odor and the helpers are very nice. the location is not too bad, 4 blocks away from subway/metro station."
989,"a very good hotel in Delhi, with clean rooms,excellent service, friendly and helpful staff. the hotel manager, Mr. Bathia was so friendly top arrange for usn an wo9nderful trip to Agra Pushkar and Jaipur, offering us for the best price hoytels of good standards and also helping us with the transport along all my stay."
990,"hotel Madonna is out of the way and the neighborhood is truly India - loud all the time, with plenty of honking to keep you awake at night. compared to the place we stayed in Bombay (thicker walls), this was like sleeping in a rock concert. the bed was uncomfortable, the bathroom was fairly grungy."
991,"the owner, Mr. Pintoo, helped me to reach every place I wanted to visit. the hotel is located near the metro, so very usefull to see the city. I'm going back in a few months, can't wait!"
992,"this hotle is locted colesed to the market place and suitable to go for site seeing. it's very clean and the staff are so kind to guests.thank you so much for evey thing, India will be our second home after Ethiopia."
993,"Delhi is a pretty hard place to get accomodations under $100 that are reasonable. hotel Madonna is not so bad, at $81 including taxes and breakfast, and the manager was very good at making reasonably-priced car and travel arrangements for us. the area is also nice, as there aren't many tourists around to attract touts &amp; beggars."
994,"the people were nice enough, but I got the sense that they would try to deceive me. at check-out time, they tried to overcharge me, and they quickly rectified it. the breakfast is included - but nothing special. The dining room is subterranean and smelly."
995,"the tripadvisor reviews for this hotel seemed okay so we booked this for 4 nights via internet. the hotel was 500R+ cheaper than poorer sounding alternatives in Connaught Place. also Karol Bagh market area, wih indian and western restaurants, is only 10 minutes walk, as is the metro station that provides a pleasant alternative to bargaining fares with rickshaw drivers."
996,the hotel was good but the restaurant was of poor standard every time you entered it smelt really bad; hygine was not of top of the list. tour organisers were good and we enjoyed the tour. our room was clean but basic. if you visit delhi be aware of profit making scandles your guide and taxi driver are usually in to make some money. we came across this when our guide would not let us go where we wanted to go and forcing us to buy things that we did not want
997,"the location is by Karol Bagh station, which is convenient to get to various places (Old Delhi, Connaught Pl., etc.). room was very clean, but if you can you should try and get a room in the back."
998,"there is a lack of mid-range hotels in India, there seems to be only $20-$25 hotels. the Madonna is under the same ownership as one 100m away which is not part of the Intl group."
999,"the bathroom suite was black and the bath itself was peeling and a safety hazard. the toilet had one of those'sanitized for you convenience&quot; labels on it which was joke as it was not clean.the shower curtain was filthy.Breakfast was OK.with regards to the new wing mentioned by the previous reviewer, I don't think this is being marketed as part of the Mehar as its looks from the photos in the different league.I would chose not to stay"
1000,"the new hotel wing is just adjacent to the Mehar Castle, in Karol Bagh. the hotel is all new, with relatively generous, classy, ensuite rooms, tiled flooring and modern style furniture with latest appliances (a/c, TV, ceiling fan, fridge, safety lockers, etc.)"
1001,"the cold shower is not something i would complain about since I didn't get it at 8 of the 9 hotels I stayed at. it's not the safest area to start out in, but you can get good bargains, and it’s close to the metro. the phone in the room is on a rotary dial system."
1002,hotel provides good hospitality.we were provided with a family room which had two double beds. the room was perfect for my wife and my two children.
1003,"my wife and I stayed in Room # 208 (Double Deluxe Room at INR 1690/night, as advertised on their web site) the room is located within 5 minutes' walk to Karol bagh metro station."
1004,"I have stayed in many hotels in india, metro Heights was the best of the hotel especially in karol bagh area. the staff is friendly,the rooms were clean and well decoated with a big L.C.D."
1005,"the staff who actually did the work were lovely. but the management were dreadful and couldn't have cared less when we arrived back after travelling for 23 hours to find that, even though we were pre-paid, they'd put someone else in our room and we had nowjere to stay!"
1006,metro Heights had to offer us in delhi near the metro sation. we reached Metro Heights at middle of the night and had our confirmed bookin so were checked in and found a decent accommodation in what we had paid ($70 usd)
1007,we were greeted at the reception nicely and were checked in. staright went to the bath room and had nice hot water shower(i was not sure i would get hot bath) the food took some time to come as we was ttold that it is cooked fresh.Food was good set up and decent enough considering it was in the package as complimentary.MOST imp. Part of our stay was that the hotel was clean and safe for family.
1008,"we stayed at the metro Heights as part of an organised tour. but the hotel wasn't the worst in india, but that is not a lot. the room itself was reasonably clean (including the bathroom), and there was enough hot(tish) water, although the bathtub was cracked so that only showering was possible."
1009,hotel Metro Heights was fine but not great value for money. staff were largely unhelpful and the included breakfast left a lot to be desired. cost approximately RS 2600 which I would say was daylight robbery for the level of service provided.
1010,"the hotel offers room for 75 usd, but books through agents for only 20. staff-sideentrance is open at all times, so no security on all floors."
1011,there are many hotels in Karol Bagh so just go to one of the others and check out the rooms. avoid this place if possible.
1012,"the two new rooms were bad compared to 111. one room had the smell of sewage. the front desk refused to provide air conditioning. we chose not to support this behavior by staying here again, and we moved next door to the Hotel Singh Sahib."
1013,"hotel staff are unfriendly, and un co-operative, especially towards females. only stay here if you must or it is part of you tour package."
1014,staff on the counter delivered service that was akin to that of Faulty Towers. they asked for clean towels which arrived after 90 minutes and an additional request for an extra bed in the room took two hours. to get the attention of the staff was an exercise in patience where we had to wait for them to stop watching the telly in lobby or stop chatting to their friends who would often drop by for social visit.
1015,"metro Heights is sort of best-you-can-get in the lower price range (up to $ 75) in Delhi. breakfast consist of hot Indian dishes, toast and coffee/tea, a number of Dutch travel groups use the hotel, I think because they can't find anything better in that price bracket too."
1016,"the hotel Metro Heights, in Karolbagh, was our base in Delhi during our 3 week trip to India. it's within walking distance of the shopping areas, which is a bonus if you are into shopping. the rooms are okay."
1017,"the hotel is decently priced and closer to the main shopping strip in Karol Bagh. the suites are around $75 including breakfast and are quite large - the service has been better than other hotels and when the internet access was not working, they called someone in on a Sunday to check it out.i would stay here again again."
1018,we chose this place to be near the train station as we flew in at midnight and needed to catch a 7am train. the room was small but he A/c worked and the twin beds were clean and not too hard. only problem was that we couldn't find the hallway lightswitch and it was dark trying to leave the hotel!
1019,"if you're thinking of staying at this hotel, please don't. the hotel itself was down an alleyway, but I guess a lot of Delhi hotels are. The room was good size - but even though the sheets and pillowcases had been cleaned, they certainly didn’t look it. i'm not sure what to expect from the mohan international, it's an understatement, and just underlines how little the Mohan International thinks of their guests."
1020,"we stayed at the hotel mohan international this month for one night. the room was very basic and clean, but it was clean and stains on the sheets were very weird. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to women travellers (as we were), as there were times when we felt quite uncomfortable."
1021,"the guy who worked the front desk was horrendous when he asked me why I didn't order room service. when I tried to book a taxi to the airport, the driver charged me double what we paid on our way in. the hotel is very noisy, and the free &quot;breakfast' was pretty disgusting."
1022,"the underside of the basin was covered in rust. there are no bedsheets to sleep under, just these rugs - not sure if they're washed regularlytoo. If you get a ground floor room don't expect to wake until late! noiseof buzzers (for people calling from their room) and voices through thelate evening and early the next morning make it very difficult. and they give the hard sell on getting you to visit their travel agent."
1023,the hotel is very basic and the cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired. we paid 15 UK pounds per night as we wanted our first few nights accomodation sorted out before we arrived but with hindsight there are many similar hotels in the area which are much cheaper if you just walk in off the street.
1024,"airport pickup didn't show up, but 2 hours late. the manager kept stalking me on the hotelroom phone about tours he wanted to sell, they staff were almost agressively pushy about arranging city-tours."
1025,"there are atleast 50 other similar hotels around this one and you don't need to book this online. if you are looking for this price range, simply get off the train at the main station, walk around, ask to look at room and bed sheets before you select one, BUT DON&quot;t GO WITH HOTEL MOHAN. its dirty, noisy, expensive, and not worth the hassle. front desk is not helpful. I got this hotel from another site and based on the listing, I figured it"
1026,hotel is located at the MAIN TRAIN STATION area which is a full 8 minutes by TAXI and quite dangerous area even in the daytime. hotel club (20 euros night) charges OUTRAGEOUS for Delhi for this type of hotel and shameful considering the condition. the cleanliness factor was overlooked as the sheets were SMEARED with dark substance I chose not to closely investigate and requested new sheets.
1027,"the hotel was clean, the loos flushed and the shower/fan and a/c worked. on arrival we felt we were stuck down an alleyway in an grotty part of town, it turns out most of Delhi looks like this, but it takes 'a bit of getting used to to'"
1028,"i wish we had paid a little more and stayed somewhere better. the room was horrible, the bathroom was filthy, we arrived to find cigarette butts in the toilet, sheets where dirty, cockroaches, etc."
1029,"dirty bathroom, fan was so loud that we cant sleep, dirty bed-clothes. driver didn't want to show us where the hotel is without a big tip."
1030,"hotel Namaskar has just 2 pluses: first - its really cheap (480 rupee per room for four people)second is great location. was really hot, fans are not enough, our room didnt have windows, bathrooms are owful. next time in new delhi we will choose sth different."
1031,"the airport pickup worked perfectly for the price of quite expensive 700Rps (and the driver wanted a big tip) the rooms were budget, no hot water, accordingly not perfectly clean rooms."
1032,"I stayed at the hotel Namaskar when I first arrived in India on the 25th January. it was my first experience of Indian driving! on arriving in the bazaar, the car had to park a bit away due to the road being dug up, but the driver carried my bags to his hotel for me. the staff were very friendly and the young Nepalese boys were great, and counter staff could not have been more helpful."
1033,"I would pay extra Rs150 for a room with private bathroom, hot showers, new, clean &amp; comfortable at Hotel Gush or Rak International (neighbours)"
1034,"rickshaw operator knocked on the door and told the hotel that the room was booked. the owner came in and let me have room 2 hours early, but he said the usual charge for early check-in was 1/2 what I was quoted by the guys when I arrived in a hotel room. if you get the larger room with the water heater, you will pay 400 rupees for it until noon."
1035,"we booked the hotel for its price and reccomendation of guidebooks. the area of Paharganj is not the best in Delhi, so if you want anything remotely fancy don't stay here."
1036,"the hotel is located in the Paharganj, in an alley just off the main market street. it is walking distance to the metro (Rama Krishna Ashram Marg station) and one metro stop away from Connaught Place. the windows were blacked out, but I could hear the street noise and the heavily polluted street air made its way into the room."
1037,this hotel Namaskar is the first on top of the budget hotel list. the problem of accomodation being recommended by Lonely Planet is that the hotel will tend to be over booked or over popular.
1038,"rooms are cheap, relatively clean but very basic. the staff and especially the two brothers are extremely helpful and can arrange for tours at very reasonable prices both in Delhi and wider India."
1039,"the people of the hotel can take you from the airport, even during the night, for 400 rupies (8 euros) they can book a taxi for you, and many other things."
1040,hotel is average. location is midst of Karol bagh the populated area of Old Delhi. close to many places though. we stayed here as we needed to visit US Consulate for an interview. room was very good though no balcony. AC was good. Had a problem with the bathroom lock. Got locked out from inside. Bathroom has new jacuuzi but it was not that effective and was malfunctioning.
1041,"i went to Delhi for a tour with my family consisting of 3 members. we had booked rooms in an other hotel but we reached late at nite coz of the big traffic block in delhi. the other hotels people said that the room was not available at the hotel and that they have arranged room in the nearby hotel. it was very small and very conjusted.we could hardly move around...the bed spread, linens etc were so untidy and he think it hadn"
1042,my voucher for the room was deemed meaningless. a reservation at the hotel might be honored if no one else takes your room before you arrive.
1043,"a hotel like this should be less than US$10, not more. it's not like the pictures at all, but the rate for the hotel should not be more."
1044,i booked my hotel from the website and made the payment of ther. the hotel website is [--] and it is 'value for money' and ppl say that that it's value for cash but he will say it was more than value of money one difficulty it experienced was that tv cabel was not working for 2 hour or so but later corrected it so a recamend each and everyone to visit this hotel and the site is'
1045,"'you *would* like a package tour to the Taj Mahal in Agra,' he says. the hotel has free wireless internet and is based in the u.s. but it's not legal tender if they're ripped - and this bill was ancient, but intact--not actually ripping. i'm 90% sure this guy brought the bill back because it was old, and of course since I didn't have any other small bills of the same denomination, I did give him"
1046,I got hotel booked from my indian partners &amp; this is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. everything from the service to the rooms was just terrible. check In system was horrible!
1047,stayed there for a week. Great service. Awesome staff! Rooms are 5 star standard. Definitely you will get value for money to stay here.
1048,we stayed only one night and our room was close to the reception. all the noise from the hall way and reception could clearly be heard all night. also there were some cat fights under the window providing more noise. try to get a room far away from reception and/or wear earplugs.Eevrything else worked OK.
1049,"Connaught Place itself is undergoing extensive restoration, so there is quite a bit of mess in the area. only trouble with the hotel is that is no lounge area for friends to meet, but you can use the restaurant for this purpose without difficulty."
1050,"Greeting was pleasant, room was small but clean and well appointed. location was so central for that part of Delhi with plenty of shops, clubs and restaurants within a few minutes walk. there was some noise, perhaps from the cinema, but it wasn't unbearable."
1051,the staff were very attentive and our room was exceptionally clean. the hotel was also kind enough to store one of our bags for a week while we visited some cities in Rajastan.
1052,"our booking confirmation from hotels.com came through and my husband's credit card was charged the full amount. the hotel was booked for 2 nights and was refunded nearly three weeks after the incident, despite a lack of room available for us to stay in. if you book this hotel through this site you too may end up in our predicament, having to pay for your room that you are unable to staying in and with weeks of trouble trying to recover the money in vain!"
1053,"the rooms inside are great, with a modern and clean decor, flat panel TV, and bathroom. the location is perfectly central, there are loads of shops, restaurants and ATMs when you step out of the hotel. all staff, from reception to housekeeping, are very courteous and helpful."
1054,"i visited Delhi as a tourist with my spouse and young kids. I chose this hotel based on other reviews. the location is perfect and rooms were very clean and comfortable. bathroom was immaculate. most site seeing locations are closer to this place and central park, Metro station is right there. restaurant is also fabulous. Overall very nice experience and would recommend with high ratings. Free wireless internet service."
1055,"the hotel is very central. the staff were extremely helpful, even to the extent of accompnaying us to find an ATM which worked. a ATM was working and the ATM worked and was able to get an sam - if it worked, it was an expensive hotel. it is worth it for the restaurant and its central position."
1056,"the hotel is very small and with no street frontage to speak of, taxi drivers may not know where it is. rooms are well appointed and confortable, although a bit on the small side. the AC can be aggressive and in our room we were forced to turn it off during the night so as to avoid being too cold. internet worked fine and was reasonably fast."
1057,"the hotel was modern and very clean and it was a good escape from the hot temps outside. staff was friendly and helpful and we met the owner one night who was also very pleasant and accommodating. breakfast is included and there were both western (eggs, pancakes) options and Indian options. there isn't much to see in Connaught Place, but many restaurants in walking distance."
1058,"the receptionist made it come in less than 5 minutes 8after I've waited half an hour in vain. the staff was very friendly and tried to help in every way - from access to internet, to phoning at the agency where I booked an ac-cab for sight seeing tour that didn't show up."
1059,"stayed in india three weeks visiting Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, west Bengal and Mumbay. the staff of the hotel is extremely friendly and efficient, making you feel at home (if not even better!)."
1060,the car and driver was over priced and had barely working A/C. the staff at the hotel also told us differing info on how much things were going to cost and Monday through Friday the electricity goes on and off every so often.
1061,we stayed two nights at Hotel Palace Height. the hotel is expensive for the size of the room &amp; bathroom we had.
1062,"the hotel is small, but very well kept, and clean. the wireless internet used to be problem. but they have fixed it. The food in Zaffran is excellent... the breakfast is to order... and always prepared well. They cater to a lot of foreign tourists."
1063,"we landed in Delhi and stayed the night before leaving elsewhere. our first night was awesome. the room was small, but adequate. it was nicely decorated and clean. no complaints. when we returned, the staff apologized,but that was about it. It was hard to believe this was the same hotel.It wasn't cheap either. we paid $183.00 Cdn through Expedia, not good value for the money."
1064,"the service here was excellent, particularly in the restaurant. the rooms are very modern and the bathroom had a good shower. breakfast is included with the rate and has good choice and decent buffet."
1065,"the hotel is better than an 'average 3*' rating but not good enough. the service was good and the rooms are clean, if a little on the small side."
1066,"the hotel was the cheapest (£98 per room per night inc breakfast), the nicest and the best placed hotel of the lot! the staff were great and very helpful. the room was lovely, clean and well equipped."
1067,palace Heights is located on the inner circle of connaught place. it is a small property with 15-18 rooms only and is situated in the second floor of the city centre. the staff at the entrance are friendly and ever welcoming.
1068,the room we stayed in was clean and with all the amenities you would expect. the location is great for getting a feel for Dehli although I would warn you not to stray too far off the beaten track.
1069,"the well located Hotel Palace Heights is a Delhi oasis. The rooms are exceptionally clean and well thought out, and they are well deocrated and all the things that you would expect from an excellent hotel have been considered such as good room service and wireless and various complimentary touches. the staff are exceptional and the service was excellent and attentive in all respects."
1070,"the hotel is small but great, in a very central location in Delhi. the restaurant was also great - I highly recommend it."
1071,"the hotel staff are very helpful and their english is excellent. we had arrived in india with only 3 of our 21 nights with a hotel booking, and the reception staff recommended an agent - Perfect Holidays, he organised the next 8 nights for us including internal flights, accommodation and driver. the room was very clean as was the bathroom with all the usual trimmings."
1072,"this is definitely one hotel I would recommend people stay at, everytime you visit delhi. they have an excellent restaurant attached, and althou living in the UAE gives you access to great indian food - it is truly authentic. the staff, right from their manager to the various service attendants are so polite, its ridiculous."
1073,"airconditioning functioned well, safe, upon arrival complementary fruit basket (1 apple, 1 orange, 2 bananas and 2 chocolate biscuits) the food was absolutely delicious, delicately spiced, and not too hot."
1074,"the hotel is on the first floor (there is a lift) which means the rooms are quiet, and its location on Connaught Square is excellent. from the doorman downstairs who loaded our luggage into the lift and whisked us up to reception, to the smiling receptionist and waiters in the restaurant - nothing was too much trouble. every member of staff was eager to please. I can highly recommend the Palace Heights as great value for money."
1075,"the hotel is an example of successful adaptive re-used building. the location is just perfect, in the center of CP and just a minute walk to fabIndia.I loved the room - minimalist, simple and very clean. from receptionist to restaurant, from housekeeper to general manager! they are doing their best to help me and make sure my stay is incredible."
1076,"the hotel is located in a good part of New Delhi. hotel staff are extremely helpful and friendly, rooms are very clean and modern. the restaurant is excellent."
1077,"the staff is extremely friendly and helpful, with good recommendations for restaurants in the area. the included fruits, water and breakfast help you get your day off to a good start easily with no hassle."
1078,the hotel was a real haven away from the bustle of Connaught Place and the food in the Zaffran restaurant was really good and service was also excellent. my husband and I stayed at the Palace Heights at our start of our Indian holiday in November. we had arranged an airport pick up with them which sadly wasn't there when we landed. on arrival they got us an welcome drink and told us our room would be ready in 20 minutes.
1079,"hotel has been renovated recently and now offers business-style, clean and tidy rooms with spacious beds and a fine bathroom. from the hotel, you have easy access to various shops (incl. Western shops with sometimes attractive proces) at Connaught Place, restuarants included."
1080,"stayed at the hotel for a business trip, the rooms were lovely and the staff extremely helpful. will definitely be staying there for my next trip to Delhi! Highly recommended."
1081,we stayed here for two nights after arriving in Delhi from the us. we went ahead and arranged for transport to the hotel (RS. 800) to avoid having to deal with prepaid taxis upon arrival.
1082,"the hotel was very clean and done in a very fashionable style, but most importantly comfortable to stay in. the in-house restaurant was an absolute treat. in india, many places advertise about their wireless but it really is pathetic."
1083,"the hotel is located in the heart of the city (Connaught Place), it is definately cheaper than other hotels around the area when we were looking. the room we had was clean, well equipped, comfortable, and close to most everything."
1084,the Palace Heights is probably one of the best hotels in Delhi in the moderate price range. the hotel is the most expensive and the price is compared to the cheapest hotel in india. it is close to a hill hill in sadir..
1085,"good points:- No noise from street- Central location- Cheap / good value- Good facilities in room (plasma TV, large bathroom, minibar)- EXCELLENT restaurant with 24 hour room service. staff who rectified issues immediately - reception didn't apologise but immediately sent cleaner, Expensive mini bar – but what do you expect!"
1086,breakfast was brilliant as they had continental as well as Indian Poori Bhaji which was delicious! as my wife was indisposed for 3 days they made hot chapatis to take into the room and my son enjoyed his cereals.
1087,"this small hotel in the centre of new Delhi, is close to everything but may be the best choice for an affordable yet clean and beautiful stay. it was recently renovated and although the rooms are small, it has aircondition (but no heating.. even though the temperature on January is quite low.)"
1088,Exceptional service and friendly staff had us staying at this quiet hotel twice this summer. the hotel's Saffron Restaurant is also a treat.Staying there was truly heaven. Our thanks to the wonderful staff who made our stay in Delhi memorable.
1089,"the hotel restaurant is worth a visit. the staff is extraordinarily friendly, and the rooms are clean with comfortable beds and have good modern amenities (plasma TV every room with international news channels for those of us who still like to stay in touch)."
1090,"the room itself is has a flat screen TV, snacks of fruit and bottled water at no extra charge. the linens were very nice and very clean. The pillows were lovely."
1091,"the hotel is a contemporary one with all the style, elegance &amp; modern amenities. the food in the restaurant- Zaffran was really blessings to the tastebuds."
1092,"the hotel claim to have 40 rooms, actually they only have 15. and the lies continue. if you have a good internet subscription for your phone, it will also work within their hotel. the room is so small, you feel clostrophobic. And the aircondition only has icy cold or really hot."
1093,"the hotel is located on the second floor of a period building overlooking Connaught Place. the room is clean, functional and'modern', with mock wooden floors and minimalist furniture, decorations and bathroom. Linen was spotless and towels plentiful, and chocolate biscuits for an evening snack along with complimentary bottled water. we stayed there in transit (arrived midnight, departed 0700 the next morning) and it was fine, as it would be if you were on business and in meetings all day."
1094,"we stayed 4 nights in this nice hotel very welll located, clean, staff is very nice and helpfull at the reception and in the hotel restaurant The Saffran. the beds are very confortable and give you every day 2 bottles of water and fruits and on arrival they serve you juice."
1095,"just great location in Connaught Place. great rooms, nice furnished and modern decoration, flat screen tv and nice bathrooms. i'll be back."
1096,"I went to india on April the 3rd and stayed at Palace Heights in the last night in India on the 10th. the hotel is a very nice hotel, good rooms, not very large but OK, with LCD TV and they offer each day mineral water and fruit basket. The bathroom was very good too, and the staff very friendly."
1097,"the restaraunt, Zaffron, is the best thing about this hotel. the menu is great and the prices are about $15 per meal."
1098,"this is considered to be the finest location in New Delhi.Rooms, Staff, Service, Reception: ExcellentBreakfast: Complimentry and excellent choice of menu.Very good decor and so peaceful."
1099,"excellent management &amp; staff:- this place has an unassuming front and is fairly new. small with 14 rooms, but excellently managed. well staffed and no pressure to tip whatsoever. asked for hair dryer, iron, extra towels etc. and all supplied within minutes. Hence found rooms not made on return in evening."
1100,the manager confirmed via email that we would have the room for six nights before we paid our deposit. on arrival they told us we will only have it for three nights. a different people manning the hotel reception gave conflicting reasons why this is so. however their reasons were not convincing as from the booking screen on their computer we noticed that two other guest were booked into our reservation. they tried to move us to another related hotel out of the city center which we refuse to due to their prior breech of trust.
1101,"the hotel claims someone was there, and we just didn't see him. the taxi driver tells them that it's behind the Odeon Cinema (there is more than one cinema in Connaught, though) the room is very small and unassuming, somewhat difficult to spot from the street, despite being well-lit and staffed by a security guard and two other employees - e.g., bellman and restaurant maitre 'd, I think)."
1102,"stayed 1 night, extremely helpful staff, clean modern room, good restaurant, a sanctuary in the middle of delhi, very near excellent metro system stationi have only positives to say about this hotel."
1103,this hotel is lovely. its clean tidy and very well positioned. it bangs in the heart of everything. I would rate it as 4 star!!!The staff are friendly and alway willing to help you.there is also a lovey restaurante.
1104,this is a really good hotel to arrive to in delhiIts. the staff were very nice even though there were too many knocks on the door for one thing or another. it was clean and comfortable but the towels were old and grey!
1105,"the hotel Palace Heights is certaintly excellent value for a stay in central Delhi. the rooms *are* small so I would not book for an extended stay - but they are as modern and stylish as you will find anywhere, for any weekend or overnight you couldn't ask for more. I booked direct via email and although I had change my original booking to 1 night (from 2) in email this was not acknowledged so ensure you are clear from the outset."
1106,the Palace Heights looked ok and the photos on the hotel website were good. it said that it had recently been re-furbished. the refurbishment is in preparation for the 2010 Commonwealth Games. took the plunge and booked. my husband and I were travelling with another couple and none of us were strangers to India.
1107,"hotel Palace Heights in new Delhi has been renovated relatively recently. we stayed there on two seperate occasions during our trip to india - and were pleased with both experiences! the rooms are very modern and sleek, and most importantly, clean and comfortable. it seems in Delhi that there are few options in the mid-range budget, or ridiculously cheap and disgusting."
1108,"we stayed here for 1 night on the 13th December after 2 nights at the Hotel Ajanta. this hotel worked out at approx £80 bed &amp; breakfast for the two of us.Room was small but had everything you needed, reminded me of a Marriott hotel back home."
1109,"our double room cost 5500Rs + 12.5% tax including breakfast. the room was excellent - comfortable, extremely clean, a nice ambience! service at the hotel was reasonable without being fabulous. reliable hot water but in our room it was very difficult to find comfortable temperature (ie. temp was either very hot or cold)."
1110,the staff were lovely and the level of service was amazing. the room was small but very nicely furnished although there were no views. we ate lightly in their restaurant on our last night in india the food was good and I felt that the Hotel Palace Heights is aspiring to great things.
1111,"this is a very small and charming hotel situated very centrally in the buzz of Connaught Place, about 45 mins drive from the airport. the staff were very friendly, courteous and attentive throughout my 2 night stay."
1112,Palace heights is an excellent hotel at a great location close to the metro from where you can explore the whole city. rooms are clean and everything works. very nice and helpful staff.
1113,this hotel is located in CP in Delhi. Simply VOW... I think its a boutique hotel.Its truely amazing. Room rent was around Rs 4500/= for single room and experience was fantastic.Room was very small but stylishly done.
1114,stayed here with friends as a hub in and out of New Delhi. the hotel arranged car service to/from the int'l airport and the Taj Mahal the next morning. they took care of everything and were happy to assist.
1115,"the frinedly and pleasant staff fulfilled all our requests, and they arranged drivers, guides and guides who took us to the Taj M. the wokers at the hotel even gave us early morning warm Nescafe mocha drinks."
1116,"my boyfriend, two friends, and I stayed at this hotel for two nights. prior to our trip I was emailing with a number of hotels in this neighborhood near the train station. Vishal from the Pearl Plaza was by far the most responsive."
1117,"we stayed at this hotel a few times. the linens are not spotless, definitely had not been changed but this is normal for Indian hotels/hostals (unless you go to upscale places)"
1118,"email communication with the hotel was very fast (we made a reservation in advance) - very good price for double AC room (no breakfast, but breakfast could be booked extra for 80 Rs. p.P.) the airport is quite far away from the city (ca 30min drive)"
1119,"the staff were rude and pushy, barging into our rooms at odd times of the day and evening. we had to wait for about an hour at the front desk whilst they checked various booking details - they seemed determined to find a reason not to let us stay. the rooms were dirty, pokey and noisy."
1120,this place is ok but don't expect it to be perfect. Location is good. it's quite close to the metro and is very close by a nice shopping street.
1121,"we were there as part of a Gecko's tour. the room was dirty, the bathtub was stained and they use moth balls in the sinks which end up smelling up the entire room."
1122,"stayed at the hotel twice during my first trip to india and found it to be good. the location is good, close to shopping and the metro station and restaurants are not far away if you ask hotel staff. as for the rooms, they were clean and comfortable. yes, there is a wet bathroom - which is common in any part of Asia."
1123,"the hotel was booked by a travel agent and for the price they charged, I expected much better. the floor was dirty, bathrooms were wet..i was disgusted. Dont know about food and restarant quality as I decided not to eat there after I saw the rooms. also the area is very noisy and crowded."
1124,"the exterior doesn't bode well and it is definitely budget but we found the staff delightful and helpful. Room was OK, not dirty. it had TV, fridge and large bathroom."
1125,"staff is not so friendly, but supportive. Room boys don't speak English, we had a bad time with them due to lack of communication."
1126,"the worst hotel I've ever seen is india a lot and for half of the money they charge, you can get much better. don't go to this hotel people they will try to rip you off after you’ve seen how dirty and cheap the rooms are.they have one suite and they put these photos on the net.Absolute misguidance.when I stayed there I called my travel agent immediatly to find me another hotel."
1127,"the hotel only seems to get Australian, American and British guests. the area was absoloutely awful. we couldn't even find somewhere to buy a bottle of water. We felt very scared, always being followed, and were not happy here at all."
1128,"it was perfect. nice room, cheap price, and especially the staffs. we will definitely stay in this Hotel Prince International again again."
1129,no prob got a taxi to the hotel which was all dark with people sleeping in reception area on arrival and one snoring very loudly in the back room. our bed was damp which in Feb is not great as it is cold so went down to reception and still staff all asleep so we picked our way over them and outside where it's dead no rickshaws anywhere. nobody moves around here until 10am. after half hour of wasting our time he arrived and convinced us we would be better booking our tickets with him
1130,"nice staff, and good internet connection. Would stay here again. would stay there again if you're looking for a new hotel."
1131,"the hotel is very close to the Karol Bagh Market, but it was quiet and quiet. the staff's attitudes immediately put me at ease as soon as I stepped inside the lobby."
1132,"stayed at the hotel on two ends of a trip to Nepal and India in august to early September. the staff was most accomodating and helpful and the breakfast was very good, but some were in no way pushy about it. I found the room clean and comfortable and felt very safe there."
1133,"I visited their hotel and chose super deluxe, I went to shop in Paharganj. when i back and saw that my expensive camera was lost, the manager called the police but they denied to Call and miss behaved with me that he was putting false allegation. I lost the trust completely."
1134,the hotel itself is fairly grotty and basic. it's difficult to find decent budget accommodation in Delhi but I really recommend paying just a bit more and you'll find the quality greatly improves. we chose it for the location near the station and the advertised pool. both of which turned out to be extremely dirty and horrible. Didn't feel at all safe.
1135,"the rooftop restaurant was surprisingly good, and a quiet retreat. the hotel arranged pick up from the airport for us at 3am which was an relief."
1136,the hotel is central and the staff are helpful. we used the onsite travel service to organise a car and driver for an weeks trip to Agra and Jaipur - very good service and excellent drvier.
1137,"we chose hotel Prince Polonia for its close proximity to the new Delhi train station, its affordable rates and the good reviews it got from Lonely Planet authors and other travellers. the reviews were the decisive factor because the other hotels we were considering had multiple comments about travellers getting ripped off while checking out."
1138,"the first time we stayed there around 18 months ago we had a good stay. the rooms were clean, the location central and the food palatable. if you're going to stay here make sure you spend more and get better room. Ignore the miserable manager who'll do his best to spoil your stay and instead talk to the nice older man (his father and owner?)"
1139,"the staff was helpful, they let us check in early since the room was ready. it was a little pricy compared to the rest of the hotels in the area, but the hotel was clean and clean - and on the quiet street."
1140,"the first night on April 27, 2008 I arrived and they did not have the room I requested, even though I booked it a week in advance. they tried to charge me the more expensive rate, but this was ok. the main problem came on my second night, June 1, 2008. this time it was me, my wife and three kids and my sister in law."
1141,"the rooftop restaurant is lovely, breakfast is included in the price and there is a choice of indian or continental. the hotel is located near the main bazaar and the train station, you can get rickshaw to connaught place - beware though they will take you to emporiums unless you give them an exact location."
1142,"the staff were mostly helpful, except for one missing wake-up call. could help book train ticket, which is much appreciated since it managed to get me one from Agra back to Delhi even the booking site I checked said it's full."
1143,there are much cheaper plays to stay in Parharganj - but you'd have to be on a very tight budget or desperate to want to keep in some of them. my wife and I stayed here in December 2007 and paid 1390rps (about 35 USD) for an AC room with shower room and balcony overlooking street. breakfast included.
1144,"this hotel was just fine, no problems, room was clean&amp; bright, staff were courteous. it's a good idea to have somewhere like this booked before arriving in delhii, u.s."
1145,"the hotel has a roof-top restaurant staffed by ethnic Nepalese who answer to the cool reception dude with the moustache &amp; gold jewelry. you know they are paid in crumbs so tip well as are cheerful and friendly, unlike the reception staff who are friends with mosquitos there."
1146,"i loved this hotel. it was perfect. nice room, cheap price, and especially the staffs. they were all very nice and very helpful. the hotel is just the best hotel for the backpackers and for everyone."
1147,we only saw one room in this hotel since it was the last one available. the bathroom was dirty which prompted us to move down the road to Hotel Vivek (check the review!)
1148,"stayed at hotel rak international twice recently whilst in delhi and liked it very much. it's basic as are most budget hotels in the area but i love paharganj and its bussle, and my room was quiet and clean."
1149,"the front desk service was terrible and the hotel's proximity to the metro makes for easy travel around Delhi...and a lovely breakfast included in the price. the only good thing about this hotel is its proximity and its location is near the city centre, which makes it easy to get to Delhi. i would strongly recommend anyone not to stay here."
1150,a homely &amp; clean environment with prompt service was great. staff was kind and helpful; the area is quite centrally located with easy transportations.
1151,our stay was fine there. Their tour assistance was good. we appreciate these guidance given for our trip. our tour guide was helpful and helpful.
1152,the Boss has travelledto 30 countries so far. Everybody was great. the hotel was a great place to stay. we stayed in two hotels in Delhi before picking up this hotel.
1153,"Raunak Hotel is definitely one of the best hotels we have stayed at in new delhi, india. the rooms are simple but large and clean and the travel desk within the hotel is great. location is OK."
1154,"the hotel is good positioned, the staff is very friendly. housekeeping, manager is really helpful; all staff members are really nice and helping. even there travel desk was very helpful for, they organized our trips. a trip was organized and organized by our travels. our trip organized. the trip arranged by the travel staff.."
1155,I stayed at the Raunak hotel in new delhi. the rooms are modern and sleek. The flat screen TV is great although they could have invested in some satellite TV to give us more channels. I mentioned this and they gave me extra with no charge.
1156,"we are an old age couple and our third time to india. hotel is good. Wi-fi, lobby and restaurant are few of the good things in the hotel. a construction site nearby was the only turn down. Orver all fine."
1157,"we were told we had to stay at a different hotel which actually was better, bigger room. the restaurant in the Raunak was fairly but at the other two hotels owned by the same man the food was dreadful.I definitely would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
1158,Best point is the location and informative staff. the hotel is worth staying. stay at best point - the best place to stay. if you don’t want to spend more and want value for your money this hotel has the perfect hotel for you..
1159,"we booked the hotel dirctlily via email. they did not charge any money for advance booking, as decided and promised we were picked up from the airpot, the reception boy welcomes us with a smile. the bed is really comfortable, matress are so soft and good. breakfast were served nicely ( I liked parta)."
1160,"we booked from malasiya directly with the hotel on our friend’s recommendation. they sent a good taxi for pick up and same nice taxi to show us Agra and Jaipore. Rooms are clean, laundry is sparking white. staff is polite and helpful. we had an comfortable trip in india becouse of them."

1226,"hotel stay in a seriously bad environment with construction, dusty and noise pollution. when i arrive the hotel, they got only 2 guests in the room and they never clean it. the bedsheet got stain on it and it's really dirty. teh floor never wipe with water - the whole curtain fell down! they charge me 1 night for RS 1,800 even if he didn't stay, it was nightmare and disgusting. you will never ever see anything worst than this before!"
1227,the staff lied about our train tickets being confirmed then finally said there was no reservation possible so they could force us into renting their car tour to Agra. the price for local sightseeing is also apparently dependent on how much they think they can get out of you.
1228,I had a great time staying at this hotel. Started my travels through india with ease and I would definitely recommend it to my friends!
1229,the staff was friendly and extremely helpful and accommodating. staff really extended themselves to make sure I had everything I needed. Comfortable clean beds too!

1235,"we stayed in this hotel for two days and this place is werth for the amount u paid. clean place, with all 3 star aminities, and the food they served also good. the staff is friendly. nice place to stay, if we are going to delhi again we will definitely stay here. GOOD PLACE."
1236,the staff spoke very bad English and had great difficulty understanding me. when they called them they claimed &quot;the car broke down on the way'
1237,friends made reservations. would have checked with them on what hotel they made reservation for. in the future in India - will insist on 4 star hotels. have stayed in 3 stars in Europe and in Russia.
1238,"arrived at hotel late pm after 6 hour drive from Agra. room average, air-con and TV worked but strong air freshener smell which turned out to be the insect repellent device in the bathroom too. we went to the restaurant and looked at the a la carte menu but the maitre d' was very persistent that we and all other guests had the Indian buffet already prepared."
1239,silver is smaller but much better than silver. service and food was good but location very good - service was excellent but not much. make sure you see all types of rooms.
1240,"my frnds booked this place for me as i hv been living in Petersburg since last 5 yrs. the breakfast buffet was grand and offered me many options. overall a nice place.the market around is pretty good, the staff bell boy and rest too were ever smiling... keep it up people...nice and quiet place in the lively market..."
1241,"most of our guests arrived from punjab and canada, so we all booked this hotel for 2 nights and their banquet for the functn. they made excellent arrangements for everything at the function and even changed the colour theme of the decoration a night before to match my dress and expected the staff to show reluctance, but they all took it very sportingly."
1242,"i visited delhi in march 2009 n stayed in hotel regent continental for 4 days before going ahead to jaipur. it was a good experience for the first timmer to india,the people are also very nice."
1243,we reached quite late night in Delhi. it was our first visit and we were in quite tension. booked this hotel through internet. i would like to share the experience of my delhi stay which part of jaipur trip.
1244,i visited this hotel in march 2009 as some of my colleagues were comming in from the us. a friend of mine recomemded me this karol bagh hotel called regent continental. on my instructions the hotel made arrangements to pick my guests from airport.
1245,"stayed here on our tour of northen india, by far the worst hotel. rooms were very small and dated. service and food were poor and breakfast was worrying as food was kept,well, warm. overall we were disappionted with both rooms and location."
1246,"staff shouting and talking loudly and dogs barking incessantly outside. rooms disgusting, dirty tables and dirty cutlery - but receptionists refused to give back passports until we paid what we wanted.would never ever go back there!!!"
1247,"this is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world. the hotel is situated in a rundown, dirty and overcrowded area in what can only be described as virtually an alley way."
1248,the hotel is well maintained with clean hygenic rooms. Located in the centre of Karol Bagh close to the Delhi metro station which makes moving about easier and fast.
1249,the hotel is located in a very narrow street in Karol Bagh area of Delhi. it gives likes of yWCAs and YMCA International House in Delhi run for its money as it can be cheaper and room quality and service is much better!
1250,"our room was on the 1st floor. very bad,smelling room.After complaining we were upgraded to the 2nd floor. we stayed there for 4 nights.Breakfast is not very nice.Staff dont speak English but helpful.Dont eat dinner in hotel.Will not go back."
1251,the hotel is quite noisy because of marble flooring in corridoors and distant phone ringing every night. the roaches were not disturbing and only a few were seen in every room. there is gap under the room door so every sound can be heard inside the rooms. other guests vere talking loudly when returning in the middle of the night.
1252,checkin had to wait for 45 minutes just to complete Formalities. no room allotment planning despite 3 rooms were booked.
1253,stayed at the Regent Contenental for 4 nights in January 2008. the hotel is definately the worst hotel in the world - the white house or Wongdhen House in Tibetan Village.
1254,"the photos you see published in no way represent the squalor immiediately outside the front door or the mouldly noisy rooms you find inside. staff either choose to speak no english or are just quite surly when you ask a question they will lie to your face trying to get you in their cafe, shop, whatever."
1255,"my new agent tried to book this place again for me telling me that my other choice was a far inferior choice. the agent's office is within blocks of both. I stayed at the Clark. it was great and cheaper. next time I will try to find another place, but certainly not the Regent Continental."
1256,"the hotel was horrendously noisy well past midnight till 1 am or later. from our room, we could hear the loud slamming of doors, the clatter of kitchenware being cleaned, hotel staff talking loudly, furniture being dragged across the marble floor. this made it quite impossible to sleep. we also encountered problems with the shower, whereby we couldn't coax out a trickle of hot water."
1257,"the website claims they have 24hr internet, a money safe, tea and coffee maker, business conference centre?. the staff are basically 14-16 year old boys who go around in groups of 2-4 who stand around waiting for tips."
1258,visitors may advise visitors to take 'their&quot; taxi service' the Taxi Service is run by a separate unit (In the lobby) and the hotel staff do not coordinate with this unit in satisfactory manner.
1259,"the stafF were very helpful and friendly with great service. the rooms are spacious with airt con-but this is very noisey. in a decent location, very bustling! would not go again."
1260,"check in staff were rude and the reception area was worse than my dog kennel. the coridoors were dark and dingy. it was truely appaling. sleep in a cardboard box on the street instead of staying here, it will be cleaner!!!!!"
1261,"this hotel is overbooking people and then transfering them to smaller, 0 star hotels in the vicinity (they have special arrangements with them) if you'd like to have a chat with me about the experience, please drop me an email at travel@astralize.com."
1262,"we were two young women traveling together, if we needed to be walked anywhere he would send a chaperon with us, drivers were always good, cars mostly clean. the hotel was good value at about £20 per room. Would deffinately go back, felt very safe."
1263,"my wife and I stayed here last month for 4 nights. the rooms are not great, the bathrooms are awful, but we spent minimal time in our room and only slept in the room to sleep. there are much better options in New Delhi, however, they are way more expensive - they definately is not a 3 star hotel if you stay there again!"
1264,"we had booked the hotel on recommendation by a Delhi travel agent against our will. we stayed there twice in tiny rooms with small windows opening to the next wall. you can not leave them open, as around there all outlefts from AC in other rooms. one room was in the reach of strolling cats."
1265,we stayed in this hotel twice during one trip to india and both rooms were very dark (no windows) and small. the bathrooms very very dirty. we also had to share the one room with numerous cockroaches. would not recommend the hotel to anyone.
1266,"stayed here for 5 nights in early september. the location is average, hidden down a back alley but not too far from the excellent metro system."
1267,staff member tried to downgrade us from double regent suite to classic deluxe room. they showed us the classic room which had a cat living in it. we demanded the original room at the set price and they gave it to us without further quibble. room service was awful as they brought things we didn't order. the room itself was large and clean with hot water on tap and television with good reception.
1268,staff at reception were poor - promises made to do things were not fulfilled. pressure was put on us to use expensive hotel taxis instead of reliable local transport.
1269,the hotel staff went out of their way to be accommodating and all were so kind and friendly. there is a travel desk in the lobby and Mr. Ahmed will do everything from make your plane or train reservations to arrange tours or just get an car and driver to take you shopping. this was my first trip to Delhi but if I have an opportunity to return it will definitely be to the same place.
1270,"staff at the front desk fixed the room within an hour. the hotel's tarvel desk was fantastic and was made every day by the house keeping staffs. very friendly staff, who would always be there to attend to your needs. would love to stay there again."
1271,"transport to where ever organized efficiently and on time. if requiring any services please ask the staff as they can point you in any direction, whether it be leather, fabric or fabric they will help you."
1272,"I book this hotel through Expedia, my credit card was deducted yet no confirmation from Hotel. Wrote many email to expedia &amp; hotel, no reply from anyone. any one can advice what to do next?"
1273,the rooms are clean and they offer a pick up service from the airport which helps to avoid any early stress.would reccomend to anybody who wants to know more about india.
1274,"non professional staff, dusts in the room, a filthy place to stay. i can’t recommend to anybody who can pay at least 25$ per night. book at your risk."
1275,"taking well care about guest coming, carrying luggage, not begging for tip,Breakfast could become better with some fruit as well. Mr.Chauhan at the frontdesk is ok helpfull, organizing whats needed."
1276,"hotel.com booked 1330rs a night, inclusive of tax. the basement restaurant served breakfast: boiled eggs, toast with butter and jam, cornflakes, tea and coffee. there was also chapati."
1277,"this hotel was a good fit for my son and I. we arrived at 2:30 am after being picked up at the airport. clean and large, quiet room."
1278,the hotel has excellent staff who takes good care of you and they make sure that you get everything on time. the karol bagh market is just 2 mins walk from hotel's hotel - just a few minutes away from the metro station and the restaurant is opposite to it. i stayed at hotel royal Holidays for three nights and found it very nice.
1279,"the staff was not professional and they even tried to cheat us many times. when they didn't get us as many tips as they wanted, they tried cancel our connection way to the Agra. it was scary and very unpleasant. so we left this place before our check-out date."
1280,"this hotel is good hotelbath,toilet,bed clean clean good sleeping very safety hotel staff very honest i recomend to all japanase tourist student or family visit here very cheap and cheap hotel my name is Kenichi Hisae. the hotel has a good price - it is the best hotel in the world. this is great hotel s l! u stayed in this room is very nice and clean and the staff are very helpful. it was the perfect place to stay "
1281,"the company of the one that I mention is, ABYSS TOURS AND My representative is Mr ARIF. I can recommend this to everyone, because they are trust worthy and generous."
1282,I stayed in this hotel in the month of June with my wife well i booked online and use there free pickup services. the hotel was very pleased for everythingi wouldl receomnd thsi hotel for any type of tourist tourist type.
1283,I agree with bad responses. Besides deceive with payment. Have reserved and have paid for other hotel. do not contact?siativ.com and a travel agent who works with this hotel.
1284,"the hotel staff there was very kind - especially the front desk and housekeeping staff. we just asked for anything we needed, towels, extra pillows, toilet paper, and the prices were reasonable (600-700 rupees for 2)."
1285,"we really enjoyed our stay here the welcome and airport pick up made a really smooth and pleasant transition when very jet lagged. room was clean and comfortable, the rooms was quiet,breakfast was delicious! arif was great helped us find our way round and deal with any difficulties."
1286,expedia airport pick-up was included and the rooms should be two'super deluxe doubles' the hotel had been notifyed about flight number and arrival time.
1287,a couple of weeks before I went to Delhi I read some negative reviews and was very concerned. when my family and I arrived there late in the night I was pleasantly surprised by the location and cleanliness of the hotel. the staff were very courteous and the room was clean and sufficiently equipeed.
1288,"the room was dark and gloomy as it had no windows and the wardrobe doors were jammed closed so we could not use it. the worst was when late night after being out for dinner and returning to go to bed we pulled back the bed covers to find there was no top sheet, we just had a thick blanket (which I really couldn't be sure is washed in between visitors) the most basic accommodation we stayed at had at least fresh sheets and towels, this place is massively overpriced and I would"
1289,"hotel was clean enough but the room was very expensive for what it was. the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful on the whole, however ignore any help they offer in hiring a taxi/rickshaw as you'll find one much cheaper yourself by simply walking down the road."
1290,rooms are ok but as with everything in Delhi well overpriced for what you get. breakfast is terrible but there is toast... Rooms are good with showers that produce a dribble... Biggest let down for us was the unhelpful nature of the staff... how do we get to Conaught Place... Dont worry ill get you scab... How much? About 100Rs... Only because we met some fellow travellers did they tell us about the metro 2 minutes away and only 8R to
1291,"we booked one night in this hotel, but when we arrived they said another guest had missed their flight, and they would have to put us up in another hotel. the area was fine, handy for anywhere you might want and near the metro if you don't want to risk your skin in an auto."
1292,"hotel Royal Holidays is a clean and very confortable hotel. rooms include tv and fridge which are handy. overall, we are very hapy with the hotel as the staff put our comfort first."
1293,chaep accomodation with hostel standards is more like hostel than hotel. hotel is close to metro station and very nice market so keep their business card with you because taxi drivers don't know this place at all.
1294,"booked this hotel through expedia after reading favorable reviews here, had to stay a night in delhi on my way to nepal. called the hotel day before to confirm reservation, and gave them my flight information for free airport pickup which was promised. they said 'no problem we'll be there'"
1295,"this hotel is a fake, we booked here because it was 7th on the ranking. the staff is completely useless, with no manners at all, and since you step into the hotel no matter about your long flight they start trying to con you with all sort of crap deals...the air con, when you look at it you turn it off as you think you are going to die if you breath that air coming through that dirt and mud equipment."
1296,"was in Delhi just a week ago. stayed at Royal Holidays Hotel in Karol Bagh, New Delhi - was recommended by tour company if i went back to Delhi again. was met with eager, smiling faces and immediate attention was given to all my requests."
1297,hotel royal holidays is a good place to stay in delhi. but tour operator connecting with hotel trying to waste time of tourist by showing expensive tour plans. room is good but they have to clean room daily.
1298,"this is a decent hotel in the Karol Bagh area of Delhi. it is central to just about anything you'd want to do in Delhi, and the metro is also just two blocks away. the room itself was dirty by my standards so I didn't take my shoes off while in my room, but I got the impression that most hotels are probably like this. and for some reason they do not put top sheet on your bed - there was no way I was going to cover up with the gross bedspread next to my skin"
1299,we stayed in this hotel on our way out of Delhi. the hotel is located in a quiet section of the city and is worth $1-$2 auto rickshaw ride from everywhere.
1300,"the hotel reception was welcoming always during our stay. we went to a tourist Information office down the street which was recomended by hotel staff,they helped us organise our transportation and train tickets from place to place on basic prices."
1301,"if you like with window, better ask for it - but might be better without window. we booked via Expedia. there was a guy at the reception named Sajad who gave us free taxi ride to the airport. thanks!"
1302,this is my second time in India in last year I have booked hotel Suncity from Expedia. this time I went tripadviser website and have seen review of Hotel Royal Holidays first I was thinking this all review is fake but when I booked through expedia one night he promised me we will pickup us from the international airport on our arrival driver was waiting for us.
1303,"our boyfriend and I stayed at hotel royal Holidays a total of 4 nights (2 at the beginning of our trip and 2 near the end) the rooms are clean with huge beds, private bathroom with shower and television, including towels and sheets. they have internet available for guests in lobby (extra charge but very cheap)"
1304,we are two girls from sweden that has stayed in the royal holidays hotel in new delhi. the room is comfortable and the service is really nice. The reception has helped us with what we need.
1305,very good hotel reasonable price good location safe for single women travellers have no problem to recomended Staff is very friendly also i use there free pickup services again no complainss. staff is friendly and friendly. a great hotel - excellent location close to all the sa..
1306,we enjoyed the hotel and stayed for about 3 days in two separate stages. the staff and front counter staff were very helpful and were able to help with a range of requests. also this hotel proviode complimentray airport pickup.
1307,"Dear TrevelersMy stay was very comfort &amp; peace even though located in the central market Karol Bagh. Room was excellent, clean and furnished, also enjoyed the restroom area with cosmetic mirror."
1308,"this hotel is always my choice when ever I have to stay very close to the airport. the rooms are so well managed and so good is the food there. if you are looking for a budget hotel, do visit this place. this is worth everything and you will also get good amount of corporate discounts."
1309,"the hotel is located in a very noisy area.- My room was very dirty (floor, walls, bathroom). the breakfast was based on British and Indian styles, but the worse of both."
1310,I booked thru IRCTC website and got an allinclusive rate. nice clean rooms. tad expensive but it was a nice hotel! i booked through the site and get an cheapest rate.
1311,"hotel Shanti palace is the right choice for meeting close to airport. its has nice big rooms and tasty restaurent, Though its a bit expensive but its worth to sat there."
1312,this hotel overlooks a busy flyover route into Delhi. the area around the hotel is particularly grotty and nondescript should you be thinking of taking an evening stroll. we would not recommend staying here for any other reason than to be close to the airport.
1313,"Shanti Palace is located less than 5 minutes from the airport with optional driver pick-up service for about 600 rupees one way (not including a tip) the room was completely granite including the floors, bathroom and counter tops."
1314,"we stayed in the Shanti Palace for 2 nights and were very pleased with the hotel. our room seems to have been recently renovated and was extremely clean and well appointed. the buffet was acceptable at $155 per night, we thought we received good value for our money."
1315,staff do not understand English. staff don't know how to smile and welcome guests. hotel needs to have more site seeing leaflets on display.
1316,we paid around 300 rupies for transport to airport. a room not facing the highway (noise) can be found in the hotel's deluxe suite.
1317,"the views out of the window may not be a worry for business travellers. I surly cannot agree with the comment regarding the rudeness of staff, who in my opinion were very courteous. i would have wished for few more choices in the breakfast menu."
1318,"to register for a room, you must sign an registration book that is straight out of the 18th century. first and foremost, the hotel is outdated. if your over 6.0feet/1.80m, then you're probably too big for the beds."
1319,"hotel seems to have been recently refurbished. rooms are small but clean. price on their website was Rs4600, we were charged Rs6600. Poor value for money. Reasonably close to airport.."
1320,"the hotel is in the middle of nowhere, next to the airport (about 3-4 kms, 2-3 miles) the staff is extremely rude and over-price each andevery item they can - e.g., hotel-airport ride (they charged us8USD, the street price was about USD4)"
1321,we were three women that shared a good size room for three nights. the hotel was safe and very clean and it was not as expenssive as 3 or 4 star hotels that were poorly reviewed.
1322,the staff was untrained and sounded a bit fishy. the rooms were small and bathroom even smaller. this place is only recommended for individual stay for 1-2 days in Delhi.
1323,the hotel is located in a nearby side lane thats not too posh. the metro station is about 15 minute walk or rs 20 by auto. food : The room service did take sometime but the food was of good quality. there is NO complimentary breakfast in this hotel.
1324,"the hotel was our very first stop after flying in and probably the least welcoming hotel I've ever stayed in. the staff were rude and always yelled at each other, with the noise echoing right up the stairwell."
1325,"the hotel is on the top floor and shares a wall with the kitchen. it's marginally quieter on other floors, but the rooms are still dirty and uncomfortable. if you're going to stay in an expensive budget hotel, at least make it somewhere more conveniently located than this dump."
1326,"location of the hotel is pretty near the sky train station. the room is quite small. there is no chair inside the rooms. window does not open. air ventilation is bad. luckily the ceiling fan was working ok. we had to wait about 10 mins. to get the hot shower. at the time we stayed, there was no restaurant in the mangement. it is being renovated."
1327,the hotel is a midrange hotel ( paid Rs. 2200) the room was clean and spacious enough to accomodate our family of two adults and one child on the bed.
1328,the Singh Sahib hotel is right next door to the hotel Metro Heights. it's ten times better to stay here and not ruin my vacation at the metro Heights.
1329,"the air conditioning only worked in the rooms, and was incredibly noisy and smelly. cable TV, yummy room service, but the porters hang around until they get a tip!!"
1330,"the room itself was fine, comfortable and spacious although dark. a notice on the door said hot water had to be requested in advance, but we ignored this and had no problems. the fruit juice tasted as if it was coloured water."
1331,stayed here in Jan 2008 and was overall a pretty average experience.Room was reasonably clean with hot water in shower but it was freezing cold(about 2c)with no heating in the room at all.lolBreakfest is fairly average also.Overall not the best value for money.
1332,hotel had been organised by tour company so we had no choice. rooms were dull and dark - as was most of the hotel. staff start working at approx 4am and continously shout up corridors at each other.
1333,"stayed for 7 days, very cold outside 10 degress and inside 18, could not pay with creditcards??? only cash, bad exchangeraterate! very noisy at the room from the other guest and staff."
1334,"this hotel was good - not amazing, not bad either. the rooms were clean, bathrooms adequate, breakfast edible and hotel staff were helpful. room service was fast and efficient. for a 3 star hotel in Delhi I feel it is good value for money."
1335,the hotel is clean and quiet and the staff are professional. I stayed in another hotel in Karol Bagh and had a terrible experience so I would recommend Singh Sons.
1336,"Singh Sons is tucked down as side street in a quiter part of Karol Bagh. the lobby is airy, cool and clean, with lots of marble, and the staff welcoming."
1337,"the rooms themselves are fine by Indian standards - the hot water problems and electricity issues described by other travelers are typical for the country. the front desk staff, however, is rude at best, and the attitude of the staff is not fine at any standard."
1338,"the breakfast buffet-attempt stops are lousy. Toast and flakes, Indian ommelette and banana's. it has the speed of a snail at stiff rate, and as the printer is also used for copying, your PC will hang up half way your email."
1339,"the hotel is in the Karol Bagh suburb of new Delhi. there are quite a few mid-range tourist type hotels in this area, with Singh Sons being the smartest looking of the 5 or 6 I spotted."
1340,the hotel was in general fairly dingy and uninspiring.At best adequate. Avoid if possible. the water pump for thehotel was directly outside are room and burst into life in the middle of the night.
1341,the length of the beds is shorter than normal and if you are over 5ft 8 your feet will hang over the end. the hotel is unfriendly and slow to respond. hotel porters watch while you struggle with your bags and wait to be asked to help. we all received an unasked for early morning call for breakfast!
1342,traveller reviews of this hotel praising its cleanliness etc are accurate however it is indeed absolutely spartan and if travelling in the late fall and winter the rooms can be cold. hot water is just warm and must be requested 10 minutes prior to use. Bedding is threadbare. Packing your own toilet paper is key as the hotel provides very little. Avoid rooms on the main street side as it's extremely noisy. Staff and restaurant food are OK.
1343,"the hotel was not 5* or even 4* in terms of presentation, amenities etc, but for being located in the peripheral of the city centre allows for good access to transport, eateries etc."
1344,"we booked the hotel through an agent for one room for 3 persons. the reception people are not trust-worthy, they cheat if you are unaware of what is happening. they claim four star facilties and rates are expensive for the facility they have. should be avioded."
1345,"the hotel is located in karol bagh, delhi. most accessible to market just opposite hotel. helpful staff &amp; definitely a good experience."
1346,"the guys behind the counter told me that the 'credit card machine isn't working' after offering to get me a taxi to go to an ATM, I insisted on using my credit card, which of course, worked perfectly fine."
1347,"in india it's difficult to find a mid range hotel. the hotel is nice, en suite bathroom with hot water and western flushing toilet, A/C and clean rooms. there is internet in the lobby and the staff are helpful."
1348,"you shouldn't come to Delhi expecting a US experience, because it won’t happen. this must be considered when an rating is given, as it will not happen, and you should not want it to. 'this is India, it's an third-world-country,' says teen travel group."
1349,"we made an email booking for this hotel one month before our arrival in Delhi. we exchanged with Mr. Tajinder Singh at least 4 (four!) emails because we wanted to be sure the booking was ok and they had the availability of rooms. of course, when we arrived at the hotel, no book was made on hotel books and no room was available."
1350,"we arrived in the early hours of the morning and the pick up was excellent and welcome. the bathroom was big and there was a shower and western toilet but no bath. we stayed for 3 nights.Negatives: basic breakfast, our room was on the road so you could hear the noise, cold/warm showers.Location: nice restaurannt near by called alpha spice."
1351,"stayed there as part of an Intrepid &quot;comfort' tour to Agra. the hotel was reasonably clean and quiet. It's located in the Channa market section of Karol Bagh, about 1/2 mile from the subway. Seemed safe to walk around."
1352,"Singh Sons is a nice new hotel with marble everywhere (including all the lobbies and the stairs) the rooms are small and basic but very clean, as are the bathrooms which have Western style toilet seats. the breakfast is quite nice - with pastries and eggs/omelettes in addition to tea/juices."
1353,the tour group I took had our accomodations at hotel Singh Sons. everyone of us hated the hotel and disliked people there. I read the other review that said it was 10 months old - I'm shocked as it seemed much older. i had both the deluxe&quot; sweet and a normal room.
1354,hotel also arranges airport pickup around 300Rs.Good family run hotel. built 10 months ago...just be careful not to book any tours with tourist operators laundering around the hotel.
1355,"we booked this hotel at the last minute as our initial plans on lodging got messed up. the hotel is located in the commercial area and is fully surrounded by Shops and the Hotel staff was kind enough to accommodate all 4 of us in a Deluxe A/c Room for Rs. 3,500/- per night. we felt that this Hotel was value for money."
1356,"the rooms offered to us were also not of high standard. their travel desk, though manned by a couple of courteous staff, do have the odd disrespectable staff who managed to cause some aggravation. they need more training on customer service."
1357,"the pictures showed a different image than what i was faced with when booking the hotel room online. the room was shabby, with cracked walls and missing soft finish patches and the Bathroom was also stinking - definitely not worth Rs 1800 +!"
1358,review of hotel Southern from one of the review sites. the rooms were good and provided the complientary transfer from the airport.
1359,i liked the hotel and highly recommed it to the fellow travrellers. yeh the tour department and the restaurants are a must try in case you are planning an weekend trip to Agra to see the great TAJ MAHALhern Travels. we highly recommend this place to our fellow travelers.
1360,"very close to airport, centre of city with lots of options for shopping. rooms and service is nice but only issue was that food was south indian so more preferred to them."
1361,hotel Southern is a safe and secure place to stay. at least 50 to 70 guests of mine have stayed in this hotel from time to time throughout the year. they never had regrets.
1362,"we have reached this hotel on 12 Apr 09, they have arranged complimentray Pickup from airport. the location is very good, nearer to Karol Bagh Market, there is a biggest shopping mall in this area, Totally Its extremely good expirence in New delhi."
1363,pakka friendly staffs from reception to bell boys. one can go even alone and stay even if ur a lady. very much safety in all aspects.
1364,"we were collected from the airport as agreed and taken to the railway station at 4.00am. they arranged a city tour, car and driver for 8 hrs Rs.750. all in all I think good value for money at £40.00 per night for double room. not the place to stay for more one or two nights."
1365,"offering the ultimate hospitality, courtsey, great food, homely atmosphere, comfort, elegant furnishings. my stay was really worth!!!"
1366,the hotel was centrally located and is ideal for tourists who proceed to pilgrimage circuits such as Char Dham etc. but please check out regarding the clause of free drop to Railway station as it is given in quotes.
1367,"the hotel is spread over two buildings. only the top two floors of the building had hotel rooms - the restaurant, reception etc was all in the main building."
1368,if I am not given a better room at the same price then I would be going somewhere else where. after the first night service was much better and my family and i enjoyed our stay.
1369,"make sure you get booking confirmation via email, as you may have problems we had at check-in. have good travel agency next door so can book New Delhi tours or other trips around Delhi, and trains nationally.Rooms are good value, providing you book the super deluxe and above tariffs..."
1370,"internet pictures are from another era so don't be fooled by those. once you get to your room, they are OK, but getting there is through a scary neighborhood - you leave the reception area to go down an unsecured alley. staff is not very helpful, particularly the middle aged guy at the front desk."
1371,"the hotel offers complimentary pick-up for their more expensive rooms. he called for the car after seeing us and it took about an hour and a half of waiting to get in the vehicle - significant problem when traveling with small children. overall, I would not recommend this for families with kids if you are coming from the U.S."
1372,"our room was shabby and cramped, nothing like the pictures on the website. the sheets didn't look clean and there was dirt in all of the corners. Random people were hanging around, walking up and down the hall all night and talking loudly. Worst was the foot-wide hole in the wall that opened into an airshaft."
1373,"hotel southern is very indian, verry nise and very clin hotel. in southern you are at home. be sure! you arn in the best area in new delhi when you live in south.bakur from tbilisi.georgia27.02.0707."
1374,"local cab to hotel picked up after two hours. local indian taxi driver start laughing at me what kind of hotel i picked-up. area, where hotel is, is quite grabby even according new Delhi standards. rooms are disgusting. outside hotel it is a mess. it was not possible to brave this hotel."
1375,"the complimentary airport pickup is a bonus, specially if its your first time in India, and they did show up...eventually! Definately spend the extra money for an executive suite, good sized room and nice bathroom."
1376,"the hotel in reality is absolutely nothing like what it's website portrays. caveat Emptor takes me out into the street and up the most filthy alleyway which leads to where my room is. the room was completely infested with cockroaches. Everywhere - running around the bed, the bathroom...I was simply too tired to consider changing hotels, so I decided to brave it out."
1377,the size of the room was small Was initially shown a standard room and was disgustedThe breakfast menu was limiting Kaamat resturant is okay The desk service and butlers etc are quite good.
1378,hotel Southern is near (five minute walking) from the new Delhi metro system. the hotel offers a complimentary pick up from railway stations (and sometimes airports)
1379,"the hotel has a great service, very clean and very good locatation. you don't need to move around for prepare your routes in Delhi if you are thinking to travel to Delhi this is excellence choice."
1380,"the staff offered to pick me up from the airport and didn’t show. when we did arrive, the room had cockroaches and was hung up in my ear. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
1381,"a professionally and elegantly furnished luxury hotel in new Delhi India with an aesthetical ambiance. the luxurious hotel southern is located in the heart of the city of new hampshire, sydney and the u.s."
1382,hii am srinivasan from Tamil Nadu made every arrangements to pickup us from railway station that we haven't had any problem.
1383,the property was very convenient and my stay was smooth. room was clean and service was perfect. morning breakfast was hygienic and tasteful. Thought i took the dinner &amp; it was decent one. I will definitely visit this hotel whenever I planned to come back again.
1384,this was my first visit to india. one of my friend suggested me to take a stay in this hotel through internet. hotel arranged complimentary airport pickup for me.
1385,the property was very convenient and my stay was smooth. room was clean and service was perfect. breakfast was hygienic and tasteful.
1386,I enjoyed my stay at Sri Nanak in Delhi. many thanks to owners Sandeep &amp; Karan who took personal care of us.
1387,the hotel is located in an ideal central area accessible from anywhere in the city any hour. it was a perfect hotel for the business traveler and is ideally located for business travellers - anywhere anywhere if you want to experience the Royal feeling!
1388,the front office was also very cordial and well staffed. the restaurant was not very good. house keeping made sure small things are refilled everyday!
1389,"the hotel was just around the corner from bustling activity, shops, traffic and typical Delhi hustle and bustle. the staff was eager to help and very warm and friendly. The room was very spacious; the only drawback is that the shower is not in a separate stall so water sprays over the floor of the bathroom."
1390,a perfect hotel for the business traveler and located in an ideal central area accessible from anywhere in the city any hour. overall set up is excellent and counter staff courteous and helpful. so much so that at times you feel you are unnecessarily taking advantage of their nature just because you want to experience the Royal feeling which the staff wants you to enjoy - it was the perfect stay.
1391,this hotel is situated in a market. good area to stay in as it is an indian area and hassle free. Good shopping close by. small hotel but friendly. staff were helpful.
1392,"the hotel is cheap, located in an area with lots of garages and car trading activities. sheets and towels were partly dirty - so this was not a cosy place to stay. the personell is very friendly tough, we were instantly given another room when asking."
1393,room was fabulous with all the facilities. staff were active with good smile on their face. breakfast was excellent in taste. hotel is centrally located in the main city. it is worth the money charged.
1394,this hotel is centrally located in the main city. our room was well organised with all the amenities. staff members were willing to help us anytime. breakfast was tasty and it was served very well by the waiter of the restaurant.
1395,"this hotel is centrally located in the main city. staff members were willing to help us anytime. also breakfast was tasty and it was served very well by the waiter of the restaurant. if you want to stay stay a stay in this charming hotel, check out our staff at our friendly staff."
1396,"our room was wonderful, the room service managed the things well. the food quality too was up to the mark. this is definitely a good choice."
1397,the bed is placed on a carpet which has not been cleaned in the last one year. the hotel staff must rank as the most unfriendly and rude that I have encountered.they insisted i pay in cash or pay 2% more if I payed by card.
1398,average hotel in the busy Carol Bagh area.not much to describe about except that you cant find another 3 star hotel for this value. the restaurant is not that great and the food too was just OK.
1399,"I was at this hotel with my parents from febr 3, 09 - Feb 7, 09. we had travelled from Fiji Islands. the hotel is right in the middle of Karol Bagh and accessible to the main shopping areas. we really enjoyed our stay here. it is located in karol bagh, close to all the shopping area. i was staying here for the first time in my family.."
1400,Sri Nanak is definitely one of the best 3 star properties in Delhi. the hotel room &amp; the food was excellent. It was a perfect stay.
1401,"we received a warm welcome from the hotel management. the room was spacious and well furnished. in fact, we are thankful because they upgraded our room without any extra cost. there was bath tub, and separate shower panels which we enjoyed the most. we were also given complimentary soft beverages and free laundry service."
1402,"Sri Nanak Continental is situated in a rather shabby neighbourhood in New Delhi. we stayed in four different hotels on our trip, and the hotel was by far the worst. the room was old and noisy, so it wasn't possible to leave it on when removing the key to go out, making it as hot as outside (+40 c). the staff tried to scam us when we asked for an hotel taxi to the local market and they wanted Rs. 1500 (!!)."
1403,"the main room seemed clean enough, but the bathroom was a disaster. towels and towels were clean, and toilets were cleaned - but they weren't replaced unless we asked for it.air Condition machines were noisy but worked ok.Staff: Rather unfriendly and not too service-minded. they also seemed very helpless when it came to things that are not in their daily routine."
1404,"we were hosted in hotel Sri Nanak Continental and from my point of view this hotel has a weak organization. we had the next problems due poor organization1.- i requested pick up service in the airport, and taxi never arrives, finally we decided to go by ourself to hotel.- the air conditioner is very noisy, almost impossible to sleep, but with an temperature in summer of 40°C obviously is necessary3.- Room cleaning can be drastically improved.4.-"
1405,"my husband booked this hotel because it was shown as a top value hotel on Trip advisor! the location is not that great. but that was not our main problem. when we arrived at the hotel, the staff were very rude and extremely lazy. hey took about half hour to check us in and the service was really really bad. finally we were taken to the room. the bathroom was the worst. it smelt of cigarettes and I wasn't sure if they had actually cleaned the bathrooms before arriving. five minutes after we checked into"
1406,the hotel &amp; services were very helpful to me as I was the first time visitor to Delhi. they had a very good trip assistance and loyal drivers with cab took me to Haridwar+ Rishikesh+ Tajmahal.
1407,"the room was very small and unpleasent. Very DIRTY. Unable to sleep due to a loud noise from the street till 4 am. no hot water at bathroom. breakfast is included, but on checkout we charged 600 rhp for breakfast. the train station is about 10 minutes walk, in an unpleasant area."
1408,"the hotel is on a busy narrow street filled with mopeds, fruit stands, and liveliness. if you are 2 or more, you'd probably be ok."
1409,"the train station is very near and in the middle of a vibrant area. the service was very good, Bunty the taxi driver was great and very helpful."
1410,"the travel desk &amp; staff were also very prompt. I booked this hotel via a travel agent and it turned out to be an extremely decent choice. they had nice, clean rooms with all facilities. rooftof restaurant serves delicious chicken items."
1411,"the room was tiny with old style A.C. unit which allowed all the outside noise to come through, making it impossible to sleep. if you arrive early, like we did, they will charge you for an extra night."
1412,the hotel has a travel desk in which we went for the same day tour * delhi local tour which all went perfect. i would like to recommend this hotel to all travelers as I like sharing my opinion so that others can benefit.
1413,"the hotel arranged nice luxury car to pickup my family as I was coming from Singapore late night. hotel Sri Nanak was nice, clean &amp; comfortable as my daughter is very particular about the cleanliness of the bathroom but she was happy as there was shower panel in bathroom with 6 nozzles as never expected in such kind of hotels."
1414,the room was very noisy for 2 reasons:1. A/C was rumbling like it was about the explode. Had to switch it off eventually because I got really worried. free wireless internet was good.
1415,"staff was nice, though, and the breakfasts were good. the &quot;aloo parata was the best we had in India."
1416,"&quot; We stayed for 7 nights in this hotel. I must say they are really hard woking people! The staff were really helpful at all times - the manager was flexible with the late checkout time, we were ready to pay the charge"
1417,"we enjoyed this hotel very much. its a nice family run hotel by Sandeep &amp; Karan, which is close to connaught places in the heart of Delhi."
1418,"the price of 2590 rupees is simply too high for this kind of accommodation. you can get a similar room at Cottage Yes Please for 900/night (and I would have done so, except yes Please was full at that time)."
1419,"we had very nice time at this hotel,Rooms, staff, internet, clealiness all was very good, we very much enjoyed our stay. the staff was excellent, the hotel was a great place to stay. we enjoyed the stay and the breakfast was great."
1420,the prices of all mid-range hotels are somehow inflated. most taxi drivers will have to ask a couple of times (and may not be able to read the hotel sign or the address on your reservation).
1421,"the milk powder sachets were 8 months past the 'best before' date and it is recommended not to drink them after this date. the staff were polite and have good manners and the reception desk were very helpful in providing me with maps, information re shops and other matters."
1422,the hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in india. the staff was not friendly at all - the hotels were not the best in the world! the resturant is fine even if the service was very slow.
1423,the hotel is tucked into a narrow street which was not really car-friendly. the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Rooms were clean but the bathroom shower curtains could be better.
1424,"the hotel asks for INR 700 for a taxi to the airport, which is quite unreasonable. air-conditioned radio taxi would cost at the most 450. of course, there are much better alternatives. however, in short, I would recommend this hotel if you are looking something in this price class."
1425,it would be unreasonable and irrational to expect everything at its best. hotel rooms are adequately clean and toilet/bathroom = above average3. Maharaja suit could be a nice option for families travelling with young kids and tight budget.
1426,"the Sri Nanak is a cozy place in an busy Delhi location. the two rooms we had were both comfortable and clean, but one room was definitely more recently renovated in than the other. on christmas day, we were treated to free simple dinner in the restaurant upstairs."
1427,"the hotel is located in the heart of the city, Karol Bagh. the staff was very co-operative and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my relatives and friends."
1428,"the hotel was great, the services were just too great. the Owner sandeep was excellent too, he had a dinner with us and that was complimentary. The Manager were very helpful in providing information about the city which was quite handy!"
1429,"the hotel offered to pick me up from the airport, for 800 Rupees. it took the driver a long time to find the room, which was small, basically furnished and reasonably clean. the staff are very helpful.A good value hotel for Delhi."
1430,Sri Nanak hotel is clean and provides a more than average service for the Indian standards of 3 star. the staff at the reception were outstanding and they helped me organize my days in such an way that I managed to perfectly combine busines and tourism.
1431,"this hotel was our first trip to india and we were charged 700 rupees for a &quot;complimentary'' pickup from the airport. the location is awful, but perhaps the rest of Delhi is like that - we only went from airport to hotel and back! there was also some problem with the online reservation payment gateway and if I hadn't checked the total would have paid about twice what I was supposed to to."
1432,"the hotel is very close - if the gurdwara is on your LHS, turn R for 1 block, &amp; vise versa. the dining room on the top floor is not very attractive, although an Indian family had a birthday party there 'good sign'"
1433,"the family that owns the hotel was very helpful and even gave us a deal because we stayed for so long time. the power went off about once every day, but luckily, it had an electric generator that kicked on and kept the air conditioning and lights running. they do what they can to make their guests happy and comfortable."
1434,"our partner and we arrived early in the morning. we had given them details of our flight by email a few days before - but nobody picked us up! the staff was very polite, helpful and friendly.Anyway, we believe that for the location and the quality of the suite we stayed, it was overpriced! I would recommend travellers to stay in Paharganj area, which is very close to metro station, much cheaper and more interesting!"
1435,the hotel was picked based on tripadvisor reviews. the restaurant on top had very average food. The hotel rooms were extremely average. it was noisy. I must have woken up 3 or 4 times in the night/early morning.
1436,the hotel Sri Nanak Continental is not in New Delhi but in Old Delhi. the location “mistake” was not a mistake but it has now been corrected. India is known for its entrepreneurship and rather than take offense on what appears to be borderline dishonesty it is better to take in your stride and get the problem fixed.
1437,"I booked this hotel through internet. we were there for our first business trip. Upon arrival, I was surprised that the check in was still traditional way of recording but with security camera in place. the food is fantastic and the staff is always smiling. The room is clean too."
1438,"the staff were helpful, although did raise your suspicions sometime. on the plus side they did help me with train ticket bookings and taxi service. another plus is that they pick you up from the airport, which is a real help since you will inevitably get ripped off by local taxi driver."
1439,"the hotel staff was friendly, supportive and helped us acclimate from the USA to India. we stayed in several hotels, and this had the best service, good food, clean accomodations and excellent management and staff."
1440,"I picked this hotel based on the reviews and the price, but of all the hotels I stayed at during my month long India trip, I thought this one was the one that I like least. the bed was not comfortable and although the linens looked clean, the bathroom was an average hotel in India bathroom (no bathtub, shower with bucket and a sink and toilet)."
1441,"this is one of the few places that seems to have plenty of rooms on short notice. it's because they will take your reservation and then move you on to a different hotel of their choice, even if you personally emailed with them to confirm the reservation made via 'a website'"
1442,"hotel kindly arranged a pick up from the airport, got in at approx 0130 am. the hotel is located in an extremely busy market place and it's the only place where I had to walk back to Delhi due to gridlocked traffic. anyone who doesn't like barking dogs or call to prayer early morning should avoid.Staff were indifferent, the last place no-one wanted to discuss the India-Pakistan cricket game underway."
1443,"it took me a long time to decide upon Hotel Sri Nanak Continental as my destination upon arrival in new Delhi. the hotel is ideally located in the middle of the city, but the metro is 10 minutes walk from the airport - and is very close to the subway and metro."
1444,"we had to stay at the Sri nanak Continental in Delhi for 10 days. booked the most expensive 3 rooms they had, which was not clean or tidy, but refunded the 3rd night. the staff were helpful at all times, The restaurant is actually a cafe and the food was good."
1445,"a good deal of hotels in Delhi is possible, especially if you are not overtired from travel. the hotel's excellent web site, fairly reasonable prices, and offers of amenities, also offers courtesy pick-up from the airport, particularly given the location of the international airport. despite the high prices and negative reviews of many low-middle range hotels, we were attracted to this hotel."
1446,"the hotel is decent, if you've been to Delhi you know how hard can it be to find a decent midrange hotel. the rooms are clean but old although some are updated, the breakfast is average compared with other hotels in India - despite the fact that it offers the service of driver, we decided to hire an excellent driver to take us to Jaipur to avoid the crowed trains and it was the best idea."
1447,"hotel Sri Nanak offers suites (with 4 beds) suitable for our 6 person family. despite the name, it was spacious and of a basic 3-star level, furnishings were not particularly new nor did the room seem that clean. the staff was friendly and eager to help out."
1448,nice clean and comfortable hotel had nice staff and great reservations department who arranged a good and affordable trip for usPROS: Nice amenities; conscientious staff; free WiFi and internet access w/ computerCONS.
1449,"I've stayed at a terrible place called Hotel Classic in Channa Market for 2 nights. but I didn't want to step on the disgusting floor over there - but it's not the same as the other reviewers. the front desk staff were great, the hotel owner himself, Mr. Nanak was there, an extremely likeable and chatty fellow."
1450,"the hotel is within walking distance of the metro and the Ajmil Kahn Road bazzar. the food was fine, if a little over priced compared to other places we stayed in India. you can certainly stay in cheaper places (R/- 2126 incl. taxes), but the overall experience had us revisit the two subsequent times we were passing through Delhi."
1451,"the staff are so responsible, always pick-up from the airport and train stations on time, and are very helpful and respectful. the restaurant is healthy and has great food! there is an excellent balcony on the roof with plants to enjoy views of the eagles circling around Delhi. this hotel has gone out of its way to provide all comforts and thoughfulness towards its' guests."
1452,"after reading the positive reviews about it we finally decided to go for this hotel. Sri Nanak turned out to be a amazing hotel We got more than we expected - the staff was polite, helpful!"
1453,we booked the most expensive room at the Sri Nanak and it had no windows and creaky air conditioning. we got another room which was reasonably clean but had a slightly derelict toilet.
1454,have wireless facilties for free.in U.K. u have to pay for them.food is awesome.with nice transport facillties and free breakfast.
1455,"this was my first visit to India and I wanted to move to a less expensive, clean hotel. my goal was to see and experience more of the'real India&quot;. I used this web site to locate the Sri Nanak hotel, which was clean and clean. the people were incredibly friendly in the neighborhood."
1456,this hotel left everything to be desired. the noise inside and out made it impossible to sleep - as did the hair from the previous guest left on the sheets. staff was unfriendly and not helpful.
1457,taxi/rickshaws tell you they know where it is but don't. filthy street even by delhis standards. grim breakfast. redeeming feature - flashy showers if they worked properly!
1458,"we had read several positive reviews before booking our stay at Sri Nanak. on arrival we were greeted by a young man at reception with 'Oh...so you are Mr Quayum?&quot;. the bed covers were dirty, complimentary with long black hairs and small dead flies in the folds."
1459,"it costs 10 times what another similar kind of hotel will cost you in new Delhi. the hotel is not a bad hotel if you compare it to other Karol Bagh hotels, but unfortunatelly it cost ten times the same price as other similar types of hotels in New Delhi."
1460,"the presidential suite was ideal for a family as we had two separate rooms within one room and allowed privacy and peace for my daughter to sleep. the hotel location is fantastic with the Gurudwara, McDonalds and Pizza Hut, ATM and the great shops all in walking distance. food is nice and room service is handy too but you can order takeaway to your room which is an added bonus."
1461,"we-a party of 4-booked directly for 5 nights, and requested the presidential suite. the room was large and has a fridge, table and chairs as well as sofa and chaise long...a real bonus is the roof top restaurant-serving breakfast lunch and evening meals. Nice to sit in at night and sup..."
1462,I booked this hotel based on online reviews. I knew that it was basic but several reviews indicated good service. staff were pleasant. Internet use was good and free. Rooftop restaurant was extremely average.
1463,"I would reccomend it over many other hotels. nice enough place. nothing great on the outside, but rooms were more western than most."
1464,"the front desk appeared helpful, but on a number of occasions tried to over charge us for taxis, cars etc. they also misled us regarding the excursions to places like Agra. if you stay at the Sri Nanak, book directly with the hotel as the rate is MUCH lower than offered by third-party booking websites."
1465,"we planned to stay at this hotel for three nights, but checked out after the first night. the hotel was very noisy, the bed sheets reeked of petroleum products and the phone did not work - but the shower didn't have a curtain and shower had filthy tablecloths. when we said we were not staying, they advised us that we had to pay for 3 nights as they had not given 24 hours notice of cancellation of our other 2 nights."
1466,"the hotel had promised us a welcoming fruit basket which we did not receive. the roads are dirty, busy, noisy and polluted. Having travelled around in delhi, there are other nicer and claner places to stay. on one day our room was not cleaned, we were told that as we had taken the key they didn't clean it even though all hotels have master keys."
1467,the hotel did send a driver to pick us up from Delhi airport. he asked for extra blankets to put under me as it was like sleeping on 'a rock' but no-one seems to have mentioned how hard the beds were though. the staff were very polite and helpful. I think it might be suitable for backpackers or seasoned travellers but not for first time visitors to India.
1468,we were picked up from the airport and stayed in the Maharaja suite which was quite good. the staff were polite and happy and the manager was friendly and takes a lot pf pride in his hotel. we had pre booked and confirmed for the following week-end but was offered an 'alternative &quot; maharaja suite'
1469,"average 3 start hotel is situated in a busy commerical area. staff and management go out of their way to make your stay stress free and relaxing as possible! i foned reception at 2 am and manager himself came with us to hospital.internet, massage chair, newspapers, airport pick up and drop off, one whole day sighseeeing tour, half day shopping tour and fruit bowel were all given free of charge together with 5 key ring holders!"
1470,"our family of four had two rooms booked for the nights of 8, 9, 10 January. our girls room had the most terrible smell in the room and on all the bed linen, and they had to lay some of their clothes on the pillow so as not to breathe in fumes. we did ask for a change, but the alternative was no better. no beds had been swept under for some time!"
1471,"we chose the presidential suite which is ideal for a family as it can easily sleep up to 5 - 6 people with 2 bathrooms. the hotel had some nice touches including free internet access, daily paper pushed under the door and fresh bowl of fruit served every day."
1472,the wireless internet was very useful and there were no problems with the hot water once we got used to the taps. but this hotel is definitely not a luxury option and the location in Karol Bagh is not great.
1473,"the hotel was average, nothing special at all. the area is not the best at night. our particular room had no windows and the mattress was very thin! the staff at the front desk did really care about anything and were always on the phone. don't trust the photo's."
1474,"the executive room was clean and quite modern, with a nice bathroom with shower. the hotel is placed quite sentral in new dehli, just short ride from the railway station. try to avoid eating in the resturant, as it was nothing special."
1475,"the hot water seemed to be by request and then you needed to wait 30 minutes. it seems hard to find a decent hotel in Delhi. this wasn't bad, but book directly as we booked through expedia and paid over the odds. staff were friendly enough."
1476,"the area where the hotel is located offers some of the busiest and most authentic street markets of Delhi. Karol Bagh is a GREAT place for doing shopping, dining, etc. once you get used to the huge amounts of people on the street, the cars, and the noise, then it's not bad at all."
1477,"the hotel itself was clean and tidy, the staff helpful and the food was ok. would i stay again - yes he thinks she would."
1478,"the staff were excellant and went out of their way to help. the hotel was very clean, the bathroom was fine and certainly better than a lot of places in Delhi at this price, that's for sure."
1479,"the whole Delhi experience is a jarring one for westerners. go ahead and cancel your trip to Delhi, or head on over to Mumbai, which is an city that actually has good airport, roads, and enough good hotels to hold everyone. the staff was VERY friendly."
1480,"the gurdwara, however, is easy to find, but taxi drivers can't find this place. if you have your laundry done, be sure to iron it, what ever the material is ironed! a couple of polyester shirts came out shiny from too hot an iron, and nothing is dusty or moldy, just worn."
1481,"we chose this hotel based on the positive reviews, which I pretty much agree with. the place is very clean, not luxury level, but for the price, it's a bargain."
1482,"I got the &quot;presidential suite for about $100USD during late Nov 2006. great for our family of four, and it could easily sleep six with its one king, one full and two twin bunkbeds. Located near Connaught Place. about 40 mins to the airport in Delhi traffic, but it took us exactly 20 minutes at 4:30AM since there was no traffic that early."
1483,the hotel is located in Karol Bagh which is a busy and tight area in the centre of Delhi. it is good for shopping and easy to grab an Auto (3 wheeled taxi) to Connaught Place.
1484,"I can only confirm all comments. good choice for people used to stay in similar hotels. Honest experience.Luc, Paris, Luc and Paris."
1485,"the neighbourhood can be crazy during market days but metro is near. a rooftop restaurant with good dahl offers good service, friendly staff and friendly service if you're looking for an affordable hotel in the city centre."
1486,"I often go to Delhi like every month for my business and will stayed in many differant hotels in Delhi, but this time I booked hotel sunrise. hotel people provide me best service and made me permanent customer and definatly I will stay this hotel. because they fullfil all my requirements and very conveniat place to my office work. Thank you very much."
1487,"the hotel is fabulous the rooms are pretty good the staffs are great. they waited for us for the B/ fast till 11:15 am since they close the b/fast by 10:30am the food here is fantastic and they are very co-operative especially the front desk manager was Ms Leena was very help full and cooperative too. the room is very neatly cleaned and the best part is they have location also just 100 m from Karol Bagh Metro, the most happening place of the town."
1488,very good service at hotel Sunrise. helpful and helpful staff. hotel location is excellent market is very near and metro station is also near. very quite place after very long time I sleep nicely because of I in my country work very hard and got vocation for relax so all I got in hotel. reccomand this hotel.
1489,"me and my husband book this hotel through a website hotels.com for 5 days. pick-up was free from airport, but we were surprised, because we have read many bad comments about hotel, and they provide us good room and morning we order breakfast it was realy very tasty. I am in Italy now but the taste we cant forget."
1490,"it was an horrifying experience sleeping in a room with no ventilation and no natural light, very humid rooms are in this hotel. I could notbreathe properly and found much better hotel in my onward journey."
1491,we stayed at this hotel for a few nights in Nov 09. The room was very small the airconditioner was much too noisy we had to turn it off. the staff were OK as long as you kept tipping them. breakfast was terriable.
1492,detergent gives a foul smell in therooms. I change my room 5 times but the rooms were dark and smelly. but had to manage the night because it was 1o’ clock at night and Ishifted to 'a nearly hotel which was much better'
1493,we werecharged heavily for going to Taj Mahal by taxi as they because afterour life at night when we came to the hotel. we could have done thesame thing from another travel agent at one third of the price - a bunch of touts who are only interested to make extra money.
1494,"the hotel and rooms there are faultless. very comfortable, unbelievably clean and beautifully furnished. the service there is exellant and you will not be dissapointed by the hospitality given by all the staff."
1495,"this hotel is a complete scam unless you already know India and are Indian yourself. the hotel owner lied to us several times when we asked him travel questions, including telling us that the only way to travel was by train or car, and that we would have to wait 8-10 days for the train ticket (a lie) he offered us car too; as ridiculous price; but instead sketchy pictures of women posing for him in bedrooms came up which quickly hid. some of the staff of his is friendly, but this guy is"
1496,"I stayed at Sunrise for 17 days last month - over the Diwali period and can recommend it. it is a newly restored small hotel, new bathrooms, furniture and new mattress etc and kept very clean.2- While some of the staff are not highly trained professionals this adds to the charm."
1497,"I paid them for THREE days, I stayed there ZERO days and left with NO receipts or bills to prove anything or file case against them. they said 'we don't have any empty rooms but we will do our best'"
1498,we have read some good and bad comments on Trip Advisor about hotel Sunrise. they pick-up us from airport early morning because our flight Finn Air was arrive at Delhi airport very early afternoon. we had check-in. They provide us very good room with window with Balcony. so we decide to stay other 4 days. hotel front manager Ms. Leena was very friendly and always smile and ask us Madam are you satisfied with our services. and we smile too and replyhe Lenna we are very happy.
1499,"we met ownhis hoter of Sunrise Hotel in Tokyo, Japan with friend of mine. hotel people pick-up us up from airport because it was included in the price. he introduces his hotel us and show us broucher and picture's."
1500,"the best aspect of this hotel is the remarkably low price -- around $30 per night. the city is terribly crowded, noisy and dirty, and there are touts every step of the way."
1501,"hotel Sunrise is the best hotel in budget price. hotel location is good for shopping. me and my wife stayed in this hotel we feel very comfortable. food was good, Hotel staff was kind and friendly and help us about shopping near by hotel and they helped us for bargaining in the price because we are from Chennai."
1502,"i booked this hotel.hotel owner did not seem to run a hotel business, he was intersted in booking my trip in india. the hotel owner promised to upgrade me only if she book trip with him - but the owner also started following me. after reaching there, they pressurised and as the sole travelller in this alien place, she had no option but to accept the tour and pay them. when she refused for the trip, the black tall man with red eyes took me to his travel agency on the corner of"
1503,"hotel Sunrise is the hotel clean and comfortable. they are take care of the matteress, bedsheet, curtains, wall colours, linen and the cleanliness of a whole hotel. I also took few pictures of Hotel by phone."
1504,it's a worst ever hotel I have stayed with. staff with no professionalism &amp; every time taxi drivers are sitting at reception in dirty clothes looking for there customers. I was badly scared to check-in into this Hotel but had no option in the mid night. whole night staff shuts and screams.
1505,"hotel mangement was very friendly and helpful and almost every one in the hotel staff spoke English. hotel owner, Mr. Singh, arranged taxi (with a guide) for us to go to Taj Mahal and surroundings and also for sightseeing in Delhi."
1506,"Hotel Sunrise is a good clean and safe hotel for family. friendly and good staff and always ready for help. we have booked Delhi, Agra, Jaipur and Haridwar trip with this Hotel in - package & we realy enjoyed our trip. driver was very good, he showed us all the sight seeing places, some times problem but this is normal when we travel in different city."
1507,"the tour guide service associated with the hotel was pretty bad. the driver in Delhi was ok. but then when we got to Agra, the new driver was horrible. he yelled at us and made the trip horrible, so we had to pay for a new tour in anagra."
1508,"we made reservations online. when we got there they didn't even have our reservations. the room they gave us was below standard - much different from the description given online, but the receptionist said that we had to change the rooms because it was already reserved for someone else. this was very inconvenient. woke up in the middle of the night by the people from reception and their friends making a lot of noise and talking very loud down the hallway."
1509,"the hotel was well worth the money, the rooms are well presented, extremely CLEAN and well fitted out with TV, bar fridge, AC and attached bathrooms. the staff were so friendly and accomodating, in our first room the internet signal was a little low so they actually moved us to the room with better signal straight away! we couldn't of asked for anymore, we will be staying here again when we return to Delhi!"
1510,"the hotel sunrise from south africa was booked by my Sister to new Delhi. the management helped us arrange or tour in and around Delhi, our car was set and were ready for our tour. 'Oh my god it was a tour out of this world!'"
1511,"the hotel had RATS in the room and the bed sheets were torn. when I wanted to leave they charged me extra money which was not agreed at the time of check in. they forced me to pay. it was a nightmare and I thought the musclemen will come and beat me up, if I dont pay I was horrified."
1512,the hotel is brand new and it shows. rooms are small but neat and clean. the staff is very courteous and the room service more than adequately makes up for it. budjet travellers are looking for a cozy nook in the centre of the city.
1513,"i booked 2 nights at this hotel through expedia, the price included pick up from the airport which was important to me as a single female traveller. the taxi driver was unable to find the hotel and the area was deserted by the time it was 2 o'clock in the morning by this time and we eventually found the travel agent who amazingly was still open."
1514,"hotel Sunrise opened four months ago and is an undiscovered budget gem in the heart of bustling Karol Bagh. hotel owners offer a wide range of services in Delhi and around the country, including custom travel packages to suit the wishes and desires of most customers."
1515,"we stayed here for 2 nights at a price of INR2800 per room per night inclusive of breakfast and all taxes. hotel manager was very helpful and looked after me and my friend as it was diwali, they advised us not to go out alone as we were likely to hit by fire crackers.food was good and prices were cheap in comparison to other places."
1516,the breakfast room was a dark dreary place and again felt very dirty. we had lunch at the imperial hotel and it was very nice. you are gonna need it.
1517,"we stayed here as part of an Intrepid Tour (North India Highlights) the hotel was a good area with lots of shops and was very close to the Metro. the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was large, and there was plenty of hot water. we did eat at the restaurant once (on the rooftop) and the food was actually pretty good."
1518,"i stayed there twice, 2 differents times, booked by travel agent. rooms are clean, no windows, mini bar, dont drink the water in there, not sealed, they just refilled from tap water. if you can find a hotel, it is better."
1519,"we recently returned from india after the marriage of our son in amritsar. our agent had advised us that he had booked this hotel for one night for us - we had to stay one noght in Delhi to catch next days flight to Amritar. a quick call to the agent got them all excited and they offered us room but we needed to sleep on the floor. we refused, then they walked us to 'a neighbouring' of the hotel- it was dilapidated old building not worthy"
1520,"we stayed here as part of our Intrepid Northern India Highlights tour. it is in a great location, with some excellent shops/restaurants and the metro within walking distance."
1521,"on arrival in india our first dissapointment was no airport pickup. the staff indicated the hotel was full already with no place for us, we found a substitute hotel with the help of our cab driver. attempting to resolve the issue for refund of money were met with attempts to blame the incident on us for leaving hotel when requested but not being able to be contacted when they found their mistake."
1522,"hotel was good, rooms okay if a little small but hot water and decent bathroom made up for it. hotel accomodation overall was okay and the staff weren't as helpful as they could've been."
1523,"we stayed at the Sunstar Grand in early march of 2007 while sightseeing in Delhi. the staff was a little sluggish and seemed very eager to earn some tips, but one has to expect this when dealing with an non-luxury hotel in India, especially in major city."
1524,"boiled egges, moldy toast, non descript jam, Sunny delight as juice, that it. it would be better if the hotel went R/O.Restaurant staff were worthless. 4 or 5 staff could'nt get a table cleared for us at breakffast. this also happened to our friends on the second morning so we ended clearing tables ourselves."
1525,"nice hotel close to the city. noise level just enough to get some sleep. room and bathroom were very clean, modern and spacious. Staff friendly and helpful. Ideal for short stays."
1526,"we stayed in this hotel twice whilst on a group tour of Northern India. the hotel was located at the back and had marble floors, cable TV, tea and coffee making facilities which was good and the decor was kitsch but okay."
1527,the rooms seem to have little soundproofing between them leading to some embarassment about using the bathroom when one's neighbour is in residence. the staff quickly backed down when challenged on these charges and when they heard me say definitively that I would not pay it.
1528,"the first time we got a small room (one side of the bed was against the wall so you could only get in it from the other side) the second time the room was bigger, had no window, and windows. in winter is served in an unattractive room in the basement, with white neon lights and sort of shower curtains to divide it in two. we didn't eat much but other people seemed to enjoy their breakfast.the street is relatively quiet and not too noisy."
1529,"the room charge was for bed and breakfast, but when checking out the manager was going to charge for breakfast. the charge is not always what the menu says some of our meals were charged at twice the amount than was written on a menu (check, check and check everything). the restaraunt was awful as was the food. I wouldn't recommend this hotel because we had to keep checking all the costs and continued to find prices were always wrong."
1530,we asked the manager for fresh towels the next day that never turned up and the following night we did have sheets but we were better off in our own sleep sheets. would not recommend this hotel unless they make some changes.
1531,"the rooms are very comfortable, with great airconditioning and clean sheets and towels. the bathroom was clean and there was always hot water, which wasn't the case in many hotels I've stayed in India."
1532,the service is abysmal (as in I can't believe these people are actually in the hospitality business) bathrooms were okay (I stayed in rooms 105 and 305)
1533,if you try to contact hotel directly the hotel you'll end up in contacting a travel agent who works as an contact point on many nearby hotels. avoid these broker/ middleman to save money by saving money on hotels directly.
1534,rooms were clean.not a great area of town (far from the center) rooms are clean and beds are ok.breakfast is disgrace and service rivals that.acceptable if you just need an clean place to sleep.
1535,the rooms were clean and the ac was not working properly. the area karol baugh where this is situated..was noisy...and crowded.there is an eating place called Raffles.
1536,we had a room at the back on the 4th floor 405. Its perfectly acceptable but we did find our room unlocked on return so make sure you lock away your valuables or use the lockers in the managers office.
1537,"the hotel seemed really ok at first glance, the room was clean, but...the receptionist holds me back, saying &quot;my travel agent'' would be here in 2 minutes and wanted to see me about my stay. after a few minutes he felt my mood about his presence and excused himself.it was only three times the normal price (which I would not care so much as it was an adequate, comfortable car), but it wasn't just taxi at all, just any private car (maybe the hotels'"
1538,the hotel quoted me 1500 rupees less than the price I paid and said they were available. when I went back they tried to charge me more and on checking out were shouting abuse and all sorts. I would never stay at this hotel ever again and advise anyone NOT to STAY HERE. we are non resident Indians and they are looking to rip us off so I can only imagine what they do to tourists.
1539,"the food was great, the service was prompt and the rooms were good. the only downside is the neighborhood, Karol Bagh is quite chaotic and noisy...but then again all of Delhi is that way!!!!!"
1540,"sunstar Grand and Residency are two different hotels. they must be under the same ownership and close to each other, that's why it gets a bit confusing. I will post my review under Sunstar grand."
1541,great rooftop terrace for breakfast if you get up early (only one shady table for the latecomers) thankfully breakfast is cheerfully delivered to your room.
1542,"our room was large, clean, confortable, the bathroom huge with an amazing bathtub... the food was also excellent and service above average. I am going back there in few days and definitely recommend it."
1543,"we stayed in hotel Sunstar for 2 days in December and the experience was horrible. the room looked like a dungeom and there is constant noice all night and bugs all over the rooms - and it was only slightly better than the other room. we paid an exhorbitant amount for COX and KINGS travel agency for out Delhi-Agra-Jaipur trip, which was the only hotel available in Delhi."
1544,"the service was good, and the tariff is an added attraction, really less. Considering the area (Karol Baug), the price is affordable."
1545,"we booked a &quot;SUITE' with king bed for two adults and two children. when we checked out, we were charged for the extra bed. the manager on duty will not remove the charge until I went on the web and showed him the confirmation email mentioning no additional charge for 'roll away bed'"
1546,check In was quick late night menu exhaustive and service commendable. the hotel is neat and clean with internet access facility and a travel desk.
1547,"hotel is close to all basic necessities and the metro rail station, which is a great boon getting around delhi. good for tourist, business, in city hotel tucked in shopping area of karol bagh."
1548,booked the hotel online after reading tripadvisor reviewsIts cheap and you get what you pay for. i stayed for two saysin january Had a very comfortable stay at this hotel.good room/laundry service Execllent restuarant Excellent service through-out the stay.
1549,the hotel is on a street just off the main street in Karol Bagh and perfect for the metro. we got persuaded into visiting some carpet shops on the way - but it was definitely not ours and if you’re like us to be avoided. the staff are helpful and no problems with anything there.
1550,"taxi driver tried to drop me off at swati deluxe, and wouldn't go anywhere when he told him i was at the wrong hotel. the room itself was quite small, but with decent decor, aircon was right over both of the beds like 2 feet next to one, which made it impossible to actually use while in either bed."
1551,"the rate we paid got us a room with beds and clean sheets. the shower for the room rate was not clear as such but the water is hot so i guess that compensates for that. if you are only there for one or two nights, you will be back one day but not to the hotel swati."
1552,"for around $50 a night you get very good food, helpful service, and above adequate (clean) room facilities. if you can show some self restraint, its definitely worth it!"
1553,staff was very accomodating and arranged a cab for us to the airport at 0130 am. restaurant Suruchi was excellent. good vegetarian food and complimentary buffet breakfast.
1554,"the hotel arranged a taxi to the airport for me, although the agreed price was about INR 350. it was on time - although there are only one handful in the city, so probably an premium worth paying for convenience's sake."
1555,"the hotel has the following address:Hotel Swati15 A / 56, W.E.A., Karol Bagh,Opp. Roopak Stores, Ajmal Khan Road, New Delhi - 110005(India)"
1556,"air conditioner caught fire on way back in a different room. took 15 to 20 minutes to get any staff to come and send the boy to their room. no fire alarms and no evacuation of course, although they did give us another room! stayed here at the beginning and end of an adventure travel type tour down the Ganges."
1557,"our room was the standard room for 2000rps a night. it was spacious with cable tv, fridge, aircon, in-room safe and comfy beds and pillows - and free wi-fi internet to all the rooms. the restaurant serves excellent veg. Thalis and breakfast is included in the price."
1558,great size hotel tucked away in Karol Bagh. good room/laundry serviceExecllent restuarant with regional vegetarian thali's - these are unlimited as well!Breakfast is good buffet choice (the freshly made 'theplas' are a must!)
1559,"staff begin work at 5am, opening and closing doors, taking linen from nearby cabinets, talking, dragging chairs and tables etc. - all with much noise. Nearby room had its bathroom just behind our heads, heard every opening of water, shower etc, very annoying.complaints did not help. hotel breakfast at nearby restaurantvery very poor, even didn't have eggs... a good breakfast! staff are not isolated from internal noise, staff start work's st i stayed in the room "
1560,"the hotel is in the middle of Karol Bagh - close to shops, food outlets, metro station. the nternet Wifi is free (and working), plus a computer near the front desk which helped me serach abt whr to go, eat etc whilst waiting for transport."
1561,we stayed at the Swati Deluxe at both the start and end of an Intrepid tour. we found the location to be very good - close a metro station. the shops around were very interesting to us.
1562,we settled on the Swati Deluxe Hotel based on reviews on TripAdvisor. they showed up at the airport as promised for the complimentary pickup. 2) Our room was basic but both the room and the hotel inside was very clean.
1563,"the hotel can get its act together for Cleanliness and Service. May not stay again as there are better places. i liked the location. close to the metro station, restaurants. but the staff is nice."
1564,"my bill also came about 9,000 lesser than my last stay in Delhi. I will stay here for my future travel as long as they extend the same facilities – discounts etc."
1565,"the hotel will charge 22.5% of taxes for the price shown on the pamphlet. Ovearall, it is a below average hotel."
1566,"mid-range hotels in India are about on par with economy motels in the States. the hotel is a little difficult to find, so be sure you have specific directions/information to provide to your driver."
1567,"our first night in india, the hotel gave us a fruit basket which consisted of an apple. we left it on our TV stand and during the night I could hear gnawing sounds! small 3-occupancy rooms and no working shower heads. buffet breakfast at hotel's restaurant."
1568,"the hotel was well located, near restaurants and shopping. staff were not very helpful when we raised our concerns that the room was not being clean and waited around waiting on bakeesh, even after just cleaning it. despite the staff's concerns, we felt like our staff weren't helpful. the rooms was dirty, with hairs all in the rumpled sheets and trash still in a trash can."
1569,"myself and three friends stayed in the Swati Deluxe on three seperate occasions during the months of December 06 to January 07. we originally found this hotel through our travel group, Intrepid, though we returned to it when we were travelling independently."
1570,"the Swati Deluxe is a very well located hotel, in the market center of Karol Bagh. it's not very expensive, and the rooms are okay, clean at least, with western facilities. don't go to the restaurant just beside the hotel (the hotel will send you to that place for breakfast)"
1571,"Delhi is expensive anyway. Delhi has very good service, clean rooms, food ok, free breakfast. the only downside is the price but it is cheap anyway."
1572,"the hotel is located down a dark and dirty alley off the cycle market in Old Delhi. the rooms are basic, dark, and small, but they are clean, cheap and are ideally situated for visiting the fort, mosque and bazaars of old Delhi."
1573,"this place is like only for backpakers"" not for family with young teenage children. bad area hotel though though a good place to stay if you stay in the st.."
1574,"hotel is situated in the old Delhi, meaning if you like to be in a quiet neighborhoud, forget about it. but the rooms are quiet and the hotels are clean and comfortable at the same time. the restaurant is not good, so don't go.service was nice enough (not amazing though)."
1575,"I visit Delhi every year to help with a charity called 'Butterflieschildrights' and have stayed in several hotels. it is clean, friendly and the food is really good. I have been made to feel so welcome and staff are really caring. you don't need to stay in really posh hotels as there is no guarantee you will get the cleanliness or service you would pay for."
1576,"it’s a new hotel but not was built &amp; maintained. furniture is good, rooms are small sized, bathroom tiles are dirty and W/C back is also dirty."
1577,"hotel is alive and busy and the alleyway to the hotel a bit daunting. staff and travel bureau were helpful when we arrived in the dark. the rooms are spacious, very clean, the bedding was changed daily."
1578,the attached travel agency was one of the best I have found in a long time. the agent Rameez sorted out all my problems in no time flat and made sure that I was not taken by any taxis or touts. he is fast at getting everything right. Better than I ma with the bookings in one spot...Just wish they had wifi in the rooms..
1579,"in the middle of an old quarter of Delhi which is run down is a modern hotel - extremely clean and cheap with lots of helpful staff. the view from the terrace of Red Fort, Jama MAsjid and 'a Jain temple' is delightful and priceless."
1580,"nice clean rooms with good bathroom and prompt room service. took away one star on account of the ordinary food served in the restaurant. Otherwise, its just awesome and highly recommended for anyone visiting old Delhi or catching a train from there."
1581,the hotel was clean and the staff very welcoming. the restaurant food is good if you want to venture out in the evening looking for places to stay in Delhi.
1582,stayed for 2 nights with my girl friend and surrounding place is very crowded and noisy. lot of poor people baggers in the area and irritate you to heights.
1583,"Kashmir reminded me of the valleys I had seen during my travel through Europe. its fresh mountain air, green open spaces, and abundance of water was a great find. Overall this trip was full of smart decisions!"
1584,"the hotel has a 24 hr restaurant at good prices. the breakfast is complimentary, if you have Indian breakfast then all is good continental style is quite confused, but does the job.the staff are excellent. The hotel is excellent for the Red Fort, the Mosque, Chandi Chowk and shopping and the Sikh Temple."
1585,it was my first time in india and i decided to go Old Delhi myself and chose this hotel Tara Palce. the hotel was very clean and food was delicious and the location was beautiful with view of Red Fort and Jama Masjid - a great place to stay!
1586,"we chose this hotel because of the reviews on trip advisor, especially the review on the travel agent Rameez. the hotel was booked in Varinassi, which was too far away from the Ghats, because you were out of town. they tend to make lots of excuses and pass the buck."
1587,"the airport pick-up worked flawlessly, which was great since we arrive at 8PM. the location is in the middle of Old Delhi, not on the normal tourist trail,i which can be intimidating for newcomers. it is only blocks from the Chandni Chowk market, a classic old-style Delhi market full of wonderful surprises down the many side alleys."
1588,"the area just comes to life and you can see the real Delhi in one place. it is a clean, comfortable well presented hotel with pleasant and helpful staff. Room pleasant but no view, aircon ok and not too noisy."
1589,"Nice and cheap hotel. the rooms are clean and you're just in the middle of old town, not so far from metro line. we stayed there 3 nights, avoid the room near the kitchen because they are always at work."
1590,"we booked the first night of our tour in india and the pick up at the international airport. they were there to wait for us, which was a good start indeed. the hotel is clean, the staff efficient and helpful."
1591,"very clean rooms, comfortable after a crazy day on the streets of old Delhi, very quiet, nice and allways available staff to help you with anything you need. great food, we could say it was one of the best food we ate in India.great value for price."
1592,"the hotel is on a alley in the middle of old Delhi, in walking distance to the red fort, the big mosque, and the NDLS and DLI railway stations. the staff is nice and helpfull - the restaurant has excellent food, maybe the best food we ate in India, available 24h p. day!"
1593,"our experience of this hotel started at the airport. the driver was there to welcome us, he was friendly and informative. The front desk staff were outstanding, they were friendly, helpful and nothing was too much trouble. all our special requests had been arranged prior to arrival."
1594,"the men at the front desk were very helpful and gave us internet for free. on our second day there we met a man named Rameez, that if I can remember works for adventure travel company, we booked ALL our train tickets (which he had available for us the next day!!!) the man was very useful, funny and excellent with English, and will listen to what you wish to do - and honestly gives you an excellent rate, throughout our whole trip!"
1595,hotel's website: www.tarapalacedelhi.comMe and my wife stayed three nights at Tara Palace on two seperate occasions in July 2009 as part of a sightseeing trip (golden triangle) the location is good- Cheapest hotel in its class that I could find- Very neat and tidy rooms with good airconditioning- Away from busy streets (See notes below though)- Check-in / out fairly easy.
1596,the hotel is about an hour (or more depending on traffic) away from the airport. we found that hotel Tara Palace had high marks from most readers on this score *and* it was reasonably priced! hotel staff booked us an airconditioned private taxi to take us to agra and back (a full-day trip to see the Taj Mahal in Agra)
1597,"the alley leading up to the hotel is totally sketchy, but once you walk it a few times its fine! my room was pretty basic, and the overall service was decent."
1598,"we were supposed to stay 3 days and felt so much at ease that we remained till the end of our stay in Delhi. the place isn't luxurious but very comfortable - it is a great place for people who want to be in old Delhi with security and comfort if you are in the old dharhar. you feel at home, all the staff is very friendly and the manager keeps to his word."
1599,"this was my first trip to india and was feeling overwhelmed by the population. I booked by hotel reservation well in advance, but was told by my taxi driver that he 'didn't know where Hotel Tara Palace was&quot; despite my having a good address'"
1600,"I booked 2 nights at Tara Palace based on the recommendations from TripAdvisor and other sites. the hotel was reasonably priced and clean, the staff were polite, spoke good English and got me to my room with a minimum of fuss - this was about 1am by now."
1601,"the hotel was clean and comfortable, the staff are fabulous. the front of house team were also first class - you can trust their travel desk to do the best for you and to give advice without expecting a sale.I'll be back, it's high on my list favourites!"
1602,"the hotel was out of the way, in Old Delhi. the taxi driver drove to this place, and pointed down a dark alley to the entrance. despite the location wasn't fantastic, the service was quite good."
1603,we woke up and walked around Old Delhi for an hour taking in the sights and all the people. the last thing we wanted was a dirty scary hotel - it is back there!
1604,this was our first trip to India and we booked Tara Palace online off of their website. the room was immediately charged in full on my credit card (£35 per night per room) the hotel is situated in the 'old cycle market' where vendors are selling their wares and tires hang from shopkeeper's hooks.
1605,"we stayed at the hotel Tara Palace on the first night of our 3 week holiday in india. the staff were helpful and courtious, and our room was large.Due to a cancelled flight we had to alter our booking at short notice, they were very willing to assist, care for our bags and advise us on travel plans."
1606,"the hotel is located in a run down area but this is the centre of old delhi. it is in the bustling streets of india and the streets are buzzing with indian daily life all the facilities are clean,the rooms bright with adequate facilities the restaurant is fine the staff helpful."
1607,the location is great for the red Fort and in the midst of Old Delhi. take advantage of the complimentary airport pickup - it's good to have a driver who knows how to find the hotel as it is down an alleyway.
1608,"this place was very nice... clean with good serivces, warm shower etc... the price is a bit high. the location is tough in general (old Delhi) but the hotel certainly stands out as an oasis."
1609,"the hotel was pretty average and the walls were pretty thin. we were so tired after all that flying that it didn't really matter. the alleyway was a little scary coming in late at night, but was much less so in the day light."
1610,they have the tv blasting 24 hours a day downstairs at reception and you can hear it in the rooms. the other annoying thing is the lift buzzer.I went for breakfast on the first day and they had jugs of water. I said mineral water and pointed at it.
1611,the hotel was a decent cheap hotel in the heart of old Delhi. it was close to the Red Fort and Jama Masjid - the first place we stayed in India! the airport transfer was slow and overpriced and next time we'd definitely skip it and taxi/auto rickshaw.
1612,"pre-paid airport pickup was prompt and as promised. the hotel is wonderfully located, if Old Delhi is what you want. it sits at the end of a small alley that looks scary at first but once you get used to the ebb and flo of the area, you see that it is busy but safe."
1613,"for our first night in Delhi we chose this hotel after reading reviews and comparing different sites. we were very happy with our choice, good and clean room, very good price,great location in Old Delhi, nice and helpful staff-never tried to sell us anything which is much appreciated in India... lovely breakftast, internet We chose it again later on our journey, I do recomment to stay here- it is a pity that is not recommended on the guides-I had the Rough GuideOf"
1614,"the staff at the hotel were very nice and willing to help us plan our trip and get us taxi's. the air condtioner didn't work and the glass in our bathroom window was shattered, as well as some missing glass-shards missing which made us nervous about mosquitoes. I would not stay here if I was not traveling with a man based on its location in old delhi."
1615,my weeklong stay at the Tara Palace was just alright. but there were several things that I didn't like about the hotel - airport pickup was great. no problems here.-Hotel was clean. Rooms were made every day and soap/shampoo was replaced most days.
1616,"clean hotel, good service depending on who you're talking, but in a sketchy location. not too safe during the night if you wanna go out."
1617,"good free breakfast included (proper breakfast, not muffins and juice boxes)Cons:Neighborhood is very, very dirty, and very poor."
1618,"the hotel is clean and comfortable and the staff are lovely. it's located in a small alley in the back of Old Delhi which may be overwhelmng for first-time visitor, but the service was inconsistent. 2 hours, one taxi and one rickshaw later I finally located it. note that their booking confirmation forms have no address or phone number on them so write them down separately! if Tara Palace is going to quiz their guests about plans then send them to recommended travel agent, they should make sure the agent is delivering what"
1619,"this hotel is new with spotlessly clean, spacious rooms and comfortable beds. the staff were exceptionally friendly, they bent over backwards to assist and the restaurant food was OK. there were insufficient blankets on the bed on arrival but more were secured from reception after a phone call."
1620,"the rest of our party of 14 arrvived over the next day and all received the same treatment. internet access in the rooms plus cable TV, prompt 24 hour room service. Nearby is busy Chandi Chowk which in day is colourful and you can buy fresh fruit at markets."
1621,Tara Palace was our first hotel in India. the hotel was clean and the staff were always willing to help us when we got into trouble.Drinks on the roof was also a treat.
1622,"unless you want to stay in a really expensive hotel in Delhi, it is going to be in the bad neighborhood. the location is good for some sightseeing, but don't expect to wander around past sundown. if your taxi driver insists on calling ahead to 'confirm&quot; your reservations, this scam is common scam. you will pretend to call and then tell you your room is double booked and try to divert you to another hotel where he gets hefty commission."
1623,"hotel was clean, with an impressive lobby, although the room was smallish, but had all the facilities there. hotel staff was very friendly and supportive but the thing which was most useful for me was the internet connection the my room as I am a techie so cant live without it.i would like to visit this hotel again soon."
1624,"the hotel staff directed all comments to my (male) companion, even when I asked questions. been to India several times before with no problems, was dressed conservatively, never had this sort of intimidation in a hotel."
1625,the stay was very comfortable and most amazing part was where hotel allowed my uncle to dress entire room with flowers. the size of room was quite good and bathroom was really clean and spacious too. i stayed there in Jan'08 for a about 3 days after my marriage and before my Honeymoon in Goa.
1626,"over priced - US$144 twin room with an extra bed. staff are friendly. breakfast is not bad. decent food,both western and local.hotel is old. wifi is okay."
1627,hotel Vikram offers all the facilites you want. you could easily tak eosme other luxurious hotel for the tariff that they charge. the place aslo is hoem to unwanted people (read :Prositutes etc.)
1628,"very clean but it has no air con in the washroom and it is very hot this time round (36C) it costs me around USD100, include breakfast, so quite good value."
1629,"the Vikram Hotel is in 10 min drive to the Lotus Temple. a Travel Agent helped us arrange our trip to Agra and all the sightseeing tours around Delhi. also booked our airline tickets to Kochi, Kerala."
1630,a decent and reasonably priced hotel in Delhi. value for money and the hotel is kept clean and maintained well. the staff are very cooperative and helpful.
1631,"hotel Vikram was recommended by the travel agent and visited it before confirming the booking. the rooms are clean, freshly done up and comfortable. Specifically choose a carpeted room especially in winters as the rates are the same."
1632,"my friend told me about this hotel, it is value for money in everyway ie food,alchol,room etc so overall you dont end up spending much in the hotel.Quality of food is also vey good infact I had the best Indian food here.staff is very helpful and best part is location its right next to all the bars, shopping and also work places."
1633,"the staff was quick with check-in, but the floor lobbies &amp; rooms had old carpet, which smelled stale and bad. the bathroom vent was woefully covered with plastic from the outside, and the food on the menu was one of the hotel’s stronger points. Wouldn't recommend or stay here again again if you're looking for a place to stay in the u.s."
1634,"this is one of the hotels with the archetypal Indian doorman, complete with giant moustache and turban. metal detectors were installed at the entrance, but don’t work - this set the standard for what was to come if you first arrive but that novelty wears off. the room was adequate though the immovable shower head was annoyingly weak, and being 6ft tall, I had to bend me knees in order to get under it."
1635,"the hotel is located near the hospital I was intending to visit, near Nehru Place. it has a small restaurant, taxis available, and the restaurant is clean. if you stay here, bring ear plugs."
1636,"hotels in Delhi are generally expensive due to lack of rooms and high demand. hotel is safe, has AC (if it doesn't fail), clean bathroom and a comfortable bed."
1637,"my family (2 Adults and 2 children) stayed at the Vikram in the end of October 2007 for 10 days. the hotel is about a 20 minute taxi ride from the centre of Delhi (depending on traffic conditions) we negotiated Rs 10,000 per night for luxury room including 2 extra beds and breakfast."
1638,there are some interesting walks around the hotel into what I presume to be fairly up market areas with their own common gardens. the market is mightily impressive (if you're into shopping)
1639,"we stayed in a superior room between 02 March and 07 March 2007. the room was spacious and stylishly furnished, room service food was good and was also reasonably priced. front-desk staff was very unfriendly and unhelpful."
1640,"the hotel is situated in Lajpat Nagar, just off the Ring Road. the lobby is bit on the smaller side but adequate seating is available for it's size. check-in was fast but not very friendly.Room was adequate in size for a hotel in this class. Bed was comfortable and TV had most of the cable channels. Bathroom was good."
1641,"in the morning we packed our bags and went searching for something better and ended up at Hotel Vikram in Lajpat Nagar. the hotel has recently been refurbished so the carpets and rooms are new and very nice, and the bathroom was small but nicely done, even better than the Taj Mahal bathrooms."
1642,"my wife and I stayed at the Vikram hotel twice during April 2006. the rooms were O.K. (television, air conditioning etc) but hot water was temperamental and twice I had to take a cold shower. buffet breakfast was rather bland and the options limited. check in was efficient but not very friendly. on the plus side the hotel was clean and safe and was conveniently located close to the Locus Temple, Qutb Minar and South Extension Markets."
1643,"neighborhood is not nice, not a place to be walking around. service was adequate. even though proximity to major tourist sites is good on the map, it took long time to get to anything."
1644,"the staff was quick with check-in, but the floor lobbies &amp; rooms had old carpet, which smelled stale and bad. bed mattresses were old and lumpy. Wouldn't recommend or stay here again."
1645,"the hotel Vikram is an ideal refuge after a day of sightseeing. rooms were spotless and comfortable, and furnishings were new and tasteful, shower and bathroom extraordinarily clean and traffic noise minimal."
1646,hotel wELCOME PALACE IS A PATHETIC HOTEL..mR miglani owner of this hotel is a cheat.
1647,"my buddy and I were working in Indonesia, and decided to take a weekend trip to see the Taj. when we arrived, weary from our flight and ordeal with customs around 3 am, he accidentally went to hotelwelcomepalace.net, where we ended up here. we had to bargue to get ourselves an extra matress for the floor, after we were situated and had just fallen asleep, they come banging on the door to move us to another room."
1648,"our Id was asked at the hotel and then transferred to room after check in which was express and took 5min only.. we were hungry when we checked in and ordered the dinner which served in 15min, &amp; we really enjoyed the food. next day on asking hotel for sightseeing hotel arranged it for 3 days. Delhi Sight Seeing/ agra same day tour and shimla 2 days! hotel had free internet for there all guests staying.Hotel have just opened there Resturant which is upto 12"
1649,"the first room we were in was very dirty, had holes in the wall, and no windows. after inspecting the room further we found rat droppings on the nightstand and the floor, but later on when it appeared we couldn't handle it anymore. we asked to be switched to a different room, after management made us feel stupid for asking such an ridiculous request."
1650,staff was sooo rude! they also had organised airport transportation for us even though we didn't even talk abt that with them. after one night in the morning one of the staff members is knocking our door and says that we need to change our room that it's booked to some other people.
1651,"when we first checked in, we asked for the exact pricing of the rooms and cabs etc... so that we don't get conned later on. we then arranged for a taxi to take us to the train station the next day and wake up at 4:45 because there was no wake-up call! if we ask the manager, he tells us nothing has been written in the books!"
1652,"the hotel is close to the metro and the shopping area of Karol Bagh. it can close on your limbs... and better you climb up the stairs to your floor... You've been warned... but it's the total opposite...I don't know if the owner ever says anything true in his words... Everything you ask is 'OK' but without any concrete actions... lol, I could write a book about this part... Well, in brief... Cabs scheduled on the eve are nowhere to be found"
1653,"the hotel was not bad but not very good neither.there is one pc connected to the internet which is an advantage. the rooms were ok for 2 persons. however, having hot shower is a problem. it was pure luck to sometimes have hot water and sometimes not."
1654,"we stayed in hotel Welcome palace on the 25th-26th October 2007. we asked the owner to give us a wake up call at 430 on 26th and arrange for the cab @500. the next morning, there was no wake-up call, no bbc waiting for us at the train station. he said the driver is waiting at station, since none of the requests we had made earlier were not satisfied."
1655,the hotel website advertises complimentary breakfast. we ordered it on the first day. Found it terrible. 'Director' apologized and tried to make amends by reducing rental charge.
1656,"we booked 3 nights in a double room with ensuit, for 800 rupees per night online. we turned up and were given shoe box, with no AC, no towels, and no loo roll, so we upgraded to 'delux' rooms, ranging from our room being the worst, to 5 bed delux rooms."
1657,"the staff was very friendlier,polite &amp; attentive. we were on the First floor say the Executive Floor of the Hotel. Unlike some hotels there was not a hint of stuffiness or formality there."
1658,"the hotel is basic and as a one time Peace Corps volunteer, I found it met all my needs. the staff was helpful and friendly and there was room service and breakfast was delivered to the room (included). the main drawback was the location which was not familiar to many rickshaw or taxi drivers, but this lack of knowledge was true for all but the most famous places."
1659,"the hotel is acceptable if you are on a budget but I think I would try my luck somewhere else next time. we stayed here for 2 nights in April 2007. Generally the reception area was OK and the staff reasonably helpful. however, the sheets on the bed had already been slept in and there were some fairly unsavoury bugs in the bathroom."
1660,"welcome palace is in heart of city, good shoppin place around mc donalds, sravan bahvan all good food joints and food of vry helpful employees."
1661,"the Welcome Palace staff made us feel like family each time we arrived, arranged for our transportation with flawless efficency, made sure we found the best restaurants and even took us shopping to their secret favorite shops. the hotel itself is clean and spacious.They provided ample hot water (once we figured out how to turn it on), bottled water to drink and the room service was very good."
1662,if u wanna live in delhi close to the airport and closer to gurgaon then it is a good place to stay.....comfortable rooms.
1663,"hotel rooms are very bad. ho heater no proper AC. bathroom is really bad, very small and dirty. they didn't bother to clean it. couldnot even open the window as the passer by can see inside. it ruined our honeymoon trip."
1664,"the hotel are built like a echo chamber, every little noise from the rooms or the reception go straight into your room. there was bad smell in our rooms, no windows and very dark inside. we felt ill from staying here, and felt better as soon as we had an possibilty to leave the Hotel. try to find another hotel in Delhi, wich make it possible to cach your departure even if the monsoon have hit Delhi badly."
1665,"the westend inn is not as horrific as some other reviews make it out to be, but don't expect a 5 star experience. the hotel staff speaks limited english (be prepared for that in in the US in general) the rooms on the second floor have better wifi reception."
1666,hotel employees kept asking for tips and wouldn't leave the room until i've paid them. taxi driver asked for 300 Rs to get to the airport because he came from there the night before and gave him 200 Rs. the hotel charged an additional $300 Rs on my roommate's bill when checking out for this taxi service.
1667,the reports about airport noise are clearly wrong. the only downside is the location which is isolated from other facilities and involves an adventure in the Delhi traffic. i have recently returned from Delhi where I visited along with some 40 others as part of a cricket tour.
1668,"room was spacious, and marble floor gave a sense of luxury. the bathroom was very poor, the walls had patches of mildew and the fittings were covered in limescale."
1669,airport staff pronounced this &quot;Westin'; a true nightmare. the shower was made of three glass walls that joined with about an inch gap between them AND NO CAULK.
1670,"travel agent booked us in saying it is a 4 star.1. Check in was pathetic, they always give bad room first. they will change to better room after you complain.2. They will say no payment was made by travel agency; but that was not always the case &amp; makes your checkout longer.there seem to be preferential treatment to foreigners for some odd reason."
1671,"we were part of a British group booked into this hotel for two nights while touring Delhi. this is two or three stars in Paris at best (and yet it is far from any tourist sites and shopping) the dining room food was adequate, although some in our group went hungry (not liking the few choices)"
1672,the airport counter recommended this hotel and gave me a ride to the place. the party went on till well over 2:00 AM. staff didn't let people know during check-in that they could not ask the people to reduce their noise &quot;since they were in their room'
1673,"the front half of the attached building is collapsing, half demolished, looks like an earthquake zone. buffet was disorganized but OK. Yes it's close to airport but nothing else is - there are no non-smoking rooms and they smell of stale cigarettes."
1674,"we did not sleep for more than 50% of the nights we spent there. staff is at best strange, usually fully dismal - preferably making as much noise as possible in the process, and speaking really loud, so you have no chance to sleep- sub-optimal food- particularly gloomy court for dinner and breakfast- not-so-clean bathrooms- no customer service and attention,- and the cherry on the pie: our second night, a drilling rig was operating just 10m from our bedroom, at 8pm"
1675,the tour company used booked me here for my first night in Delhi. it was the best option to return to Delhi later in the week. i'm looking for alternatives for a trip to the uk later this week if it's an alternative to ireland next week in london.
1676,we booked up at the white house through Colourful Indian holidays. they chose the hotel and we looked it up and it looked fine inside. rooms were air conditioned and spacious and bathrooms well equipped. the restaurant on the roof had quite a good selection so you didn't need to venture out in the evening.
1677,"hotel was good for access to Karol Bagh/Connaught Place during the day. but as a lone travelling female did not feel overly safe in the evening, though think this would apply to other hotels in capital anyway. I would rate this hotel as average-good in terms of cleanliness &amp; food."
1678,the trip to national airport was double the usual cost. they said they would exchange money at 39rs/dollar..the then current rate. the rooms had peeling walls and some mold.
1679,"the double room was quite generous and, situated to the rear of the building, not overly affected by street noise. however, since the hotel finish was predominately marble, we did suffer from some in-house disturbance where the occupants above insisted on dragging the furniture around the floor for some reason with resulting clangour a mite irritating."
1680,"stayed here for a week but went on tour for 3 days. arranged an airport pick up direct with the hotel via email but no-one was there to meet me on arrival at the airport,so had to haggle an e-mail to get me to hotel at 2.00 in the morning. the next morning when I finally checked in to my room,my initial impressions were that it was cleaner and generally in better state of repair than the one the previous night but it left much to be desired."
1681,"we had booked 3 rooms for 3 nights (we were 3 couples travelling together) but when we arrived, we were told one of the rooms had been 'cancelled&quot; by us. we ended up sleeping 3 people to a room. the next day we got our tour group to organise another hotel for us."
1682,the bed sheets and pillow covers were full of stain and were of lowest quality. major drawbacks of this hotel what I have noticed are:1. Location is at a market place. Surrounding area is dirty. hotel rooms are stuffy3. Hotel itself is cramped. no space even for taking sa stroll leisurely4. Breakfast is not at all worth for money5. Staffs are not friendly.
1683,"we booked directly with the hotel in 2006 for a one night stay in October. we were offered two free pick ups from the airport - we provided credit card details as security. when we arrived, we was asked to pay for the pickup. the bills were different to the agreed rate, the receptionist tried to charge us more. fortunately we had copies of our correspondence with us."
1684,the Hyatt is a welcome respite from the city. it is the best thing to do in the world - the lavendar bubble bath is lovely!
1685,"my room was in the 8th floor, big enough, with fine decoration, flat screen TV, coffee maker, mini bar etc. the bathroom, however, was small, in need of renovation."
1686,"the staff were alert, attentive and courteous at all hours day and night, even if my appearance was disheveled after the 15hr flight from Chicago! the quality of food was very good at both - the cafe in particular had a wonderful selection of breakfast items and an open kitchen."
1687,"we travelled to this hotel with Cox and Kings as part of a package. the hotel is what I would call business class, it offers high level of service, but at the price! the room was nothing special, the service and food was excellent, although very costly. compared to others on the trip it was extremely expensive."
1688,"the lobby is huge, three restaurants, a bar, mini-golf course in the back, nice pool, very safe, rooms were huge and very comfortable, staff was very friendly."
1689,"the hotel is drab from the outside, and there isn't much to see or do within walking distance. my biggest complaint would have to be the internet. it was painfully slow, the connection would drop far too much."
1690,"the Hyatt website allows you to book everything through it, ranging from airport transportation, spa treatments to a restaurant table. check in at executive level very efficient and friendly, and generally the staff couldn't do enough to accommodate you. I had an early flight the next day, but they arranged breakfast to be set out for me in the Club even though breakfast would open not for another hour."
1691,the Hyatt in new Delhi is light years better...Stay there. the lux rooms wash away the hectic Delhi circusThe buffet breakfast is one of the best I have had.
1692,stayed at Hyatt in Delhi for 2 nights in late august 2009. was on a 2 week trip to india and wanted to finish my vacation in the nice hotel. I found this hotel to be absolutely unacceptable for this price.
1693,I have booked through Jet airways website under the Hotel booking section. check inn was at the club level special desk and it was smooth. the breakfast was very basic english breakfast. rooms are clean and soft bed with wider option of pillows.the best part of the hotel is its restaurants and room dining.
1694,the receptionist suggested to take off spa charges as compensation which i refused as there was nothing wrong with the spa. the charges for the room for two night and the bottle of champagne which should have never been charged as Hotel failed to provide the rooms at decent temp to sleep and still charged for it which was flat. a 3 star hotelAshok UmmatCEO Brook Hotels Ltd. has been in the hotel business for 38 years and this stay in so called 5 star hotels takes the biscuit.
1695,"the services of Hotel is supreme, one of the best in Delhi for sure. ii, exteriors and interiors are royal with luxurious comfort."
1696,"the staff was very helpful, proffesional and courteous. Ambience and decor was perfect. breakfast was out of the world. Indian, Continental, Asian, fresh fruits and juices and salads all comprised of this breakfast/brunch. Servers were very welcoming."
1697,"Very Friendly,Cool &amp; Calm.A great atmosphare for business review.Foods and amp; Room were excellent."
1698,"the hotel was not as 'cozy' as the meridien. it was more like an &quot;interview' room - and they wanted 1,000 rupees for an hour to sit at what looked like somebody's desk???I won't be coming back, I'd rather try another Meriden!!"
1699,we visited there for Dinner & Stayed in one room for one Room also.....It was excellent stay for our Friends andamp; Management is too Co-operative /cleanliness in Hotel is No. 1....... i was a very good stay - it was great for the staff!
1700,this hotel is a perfect location if you have business meetings in the centre of New Delhi. the restaurant is excellent and specially the Italian restaurant has outstanding value for money.
1701,"best hotel i have ever been to, nice staff and nice service. quality of food was also very good, such a delicious food he'sn't eaten in my whole life."
1702,the Huge facade is one of the most recognizable structures of Delhi. it is located in a busy business district and is situated in the city's bustling business districts. palatial lobby and extremely efficeint service. Standard Rooms though feel cramped for space. Multiple choice of good restaurents.
1703,the italian restaurant was excellent. good service. excellent staff. a good location. close to the business district and the airport. nice hotel. very well located business hotel with excellent breakfast.
1704,the room temperature was too warm requested for correction about it and didn't bother to follow up as was tired after a long flight.
1705,the hotel is in the real sense a complete hotel. the comfort level was too good and the staff were friendly enough to give you an unforgetable experience.
1706,hotel provides excellent food. staff was very courteous and friendly. i stayed here for a day for business trip to the u.s.
1707,"it is a luxurious property, and I was looking for some Luxurious treatment, to unwind after my gruelling Meetings. despite the fact, there was no bathtub in the room, which left the whole bathroom wet."
1708,this is my second stay in 8 days. my club room has a toilet that flushes badly. I pity the cleaner when he goes around doing his work later today.
1709,"the restaurants service was excellent and food was made to order for kids and for us. front office, checkin and regency clun staff is wonderful."
1710,breakfast thopugh overpriced but worth that much much. excellent five star hotel with notable ambience. superb five-star hotel. a great location in the heart of the london. breakfast is superb. good value for money.
1711,this was the only five star hotel that my husband and I stayed at while traveling around India. everything is extemely clean and spotless throughout the hotel. breakfast was included with our room. the servers were also very attentative and there was never a wait for seat.
1712,the property location is great and so is the staff and hospitality. the check-in was great since I was on the club floor... and did not take more than a few minutes.
1713,it was a very pleasant stay at Hyatt during my cousin's wedding in 2007. hotel treated us very cordially.
1714,"Hyatt, Delhi is a great property and I love staying here. I had stayed in their property at S'pore and Mumbai as well. the rooms are excellent, coffee shop where the B'fast is served in one of the best, Staff are very cordial, they have great membership programme as also."
1715,well hyatt is one of the most expensive and this trip thus wasnt really value for money. the hotel however has a good indian restaurant and the rooms are ofcourse good and that helps in getting up every day morning every morning fresh from the morning morning.
1716,"my husband and I stayed at this beautiful hotel our first night in india! it was a lovely hotel, and was closer to the airport than the downtown hotels. would highly recommend it."
1717,"Great bed, The Large LCD TV's are smartly placed. 100% recommended. great bed and comfortable room. good modern and comfy room!"
1718,"wifi service goes on and off while you are being charged. i ordered food at 10:30pm, was told it will be served in 20 mins, it's now 12:24 am and still no food!!I've just cancelled my stay here and moving myself to another hotel in delhi."
1719,"the central reservation desk was friendly and informed us of the various rooms and told us they had avalibility. the lady who made our booking sounded shocked the front desk had refused, she even asked us for the persons name. she said she did that for security reasons???????We were unable to sleep for 2 days due to ongoing CONSTRUCTION."
1720,"the hotel is still undergoing major refurbishment which means granite blocks are being machined noisily in the reception, covering everything in dust. hotel staff seemed more keen to look after business events than people staying in hotel, so that pool was closed to 'guests' throughout our stay whilst they catered for weddings and the like! drinks were ridiculously expensive £80 or $150 for a medium range bottle of wine and £12 or $22 for an gin and tonic!"
1721,"the Hyatt is the closest 5 star hotel to the Delhi Airport, approximately 25 minutes with light Delhi traffic, 15 minutes at 2AM. the concierge can arrange for city tours and to have medications delivered from a local [reputable] pharmacy."
1722,the staff would bend over backwards for you. there were renovations going on but we were well informed and the rooms were clean and tidy. we ate in every restaurant in the hotel and would recommend the 'china kitchen'
1723,i got the room for around 200 dollars/nit for the week of indepence day which was reasonably good. the hotel is very close to the airport and has a good japanese steak house and great coffee house. but for those singles this place does not have nits club.
1724,"their service was excellent.all the time they were asking for snax, food,tea etc. they gave me all that with good manner."
1725,our company's team of 9 stayed here for a week. we made good use of the lounge and there was an conference room we reserved for one day of our stay. the food at the club lounge was very good and the italian restaurant was really good. when our group arrived they took our passports and appeared efficient.
1726,"the hotel does not disclose that it is undergoing renovations anywhere on its website. it also &quot;mistakenly' charged me for an airport transfer when I did not use a car to pick me up, but was told there was no booking!"
1727,"recently, stayed in Hyatt Delhi (October 2008) after paying Bomb. reservation was done online, but did not have room as per our requirement reserved.--Reception allots me room which already had guest staying. it was very embarrassing to walk into room with guest sleeping.. next room allotted was not as a requirement, we took it as we were very tired. whole process took 45 minutes. room service staff could not take order properly. once I received order was cold and barely edible.i"
1728,the hotel is big and usually full so things are going to happen. a lot of the guests are repeat guests so that says that they are for the most part happy about their experience. they do work hard to make things right if it is brought to their attention that you are not satisfied.
1729,the toillet was blocked and we spent two hours waiting for someone to fix the problem. the breakfast was also an issue if you don't like to have indian food: all pastries looked like have been made a week ago. we got very disappointed since the restaurant looks pretty good (LOOKs only)
1730,we stayed 2 nights at the Hyatt Regency in new Delhi. the hotel was renovated with all the mod cons. they are still the same size as the normal rooms (i.e. not that big). the room cards stopped working on the 2nd day and it took two trips to the front desk to sort them out.
1731,"we loved this hotel...Was not inexpensive, but loved everything about it. staff was very pleasant &amp; helpful. breakfast was good."
1732,hotel visit delhi was picked up every morning for work so i really dont know if location is a good one in my opinion there was nothing around or walking distance to see or visitevery restaurant visited was al least 20 minutes by carinside the hotel was perfect.
1733,"this was my second time at the Hyatt Regency in Delhi - the first time was two years ago. this time I stayed a week and I have to say that everything was nearly perfect, nice room, comfortable bed, good restaurants and good service. the gym is pleasant and although the hotel was packed there were always enough machines."
1734,"in Delhi we selected the Hyatt Regency, it's expensive. the gold Passport room was smaller, unclean, dirty and lacked furnishings. food and drinks are good, but room is average, not worth the USD. we were advised by friends to stay in 5 Star Deluxe hotels while in India, good input... your hotel will be your sanctuary."
1735,the Hyatt in New Delhi is a very TIP happy place which bugs me but at the same time I am already their so I want to enjoy my voyage.
1736,this hotel has an excellent standing. The restaurant are good for India. our oom at the top floor was very well furbished and we had a warm welcome.
1737,"this was not the best welcome to India. the service was pretty disorganized, and the location was out of the action of india. it meant having to negotiate public transport and taxis, not easy in this place! rooms were okay, but nothing special. i'd choose somewhere else next time."
1738,"the food as always is good, the rooms are pleasant (although can be cold) and the complimentary water is much appreciated. the staff are very helpful on the whole, although a little slow in the restuarant."
1739,the hotel made our stay in Delhi a worthwhile experience; check in was easy and the rooms average until we found that our friends were in newer plush rooms on the same floor whilst our rooms were the old style. the room service was excellent; as was the health club with new equipment - elliptical crosstrainers and treadmills with integrated TV monitors.
1740,"the hotel is, of course, not really walking distance from anything. the entry and lobby are very nice, check in is easy, staff is excellent. The rooms are great, the bathroom large, and the amenities plentiful. breakfast is delicious and loaded with options. Do NOT miss out on the italian restaurant. I just got back from Italy a couple of months ago."
1741,great club room. nice buffet in the evening and breakfast at the club loungeVery good spa with the best ayurvedic massage I've had in india! the staff is wonderful staff.
1742,"the service in the hotel is really great and extremely attentive. my friend and I ate in TK's which is an asian restaurant - we both rated it extremely high. the food and service were perfect. it was far too hot for me to sunbathe by the pool, but I can only assume the swimming service is as good as ever."
1743,the hotel was a club room up on the 6 th floor and it was very good. the food is worth the price one pays to stay here.Strongly recommend.
1744,the hotel is set between the city centre and the international airport. on first arrival I thought the outside was nothing special but the welcoming lobby was first class. the restaurant is excellent and whilst I was there the Hotel was adding a new Chinese restaurant.
1745,"the service at the Hyatt is great but, not worth the $300/night price. our room had a door to an adjoining room through which everything could be heard. so, during our last nights stay the person in the other room decided to watch TV at 3am and we were woken up."
1746,"our flight was late out of Taiwan and the staff at the airport was really helpful, especially since we had two small children. we went on a tour of Northern India the next day and stayed in the hotel again on our way out from the u.s."
1747,"the Hyatt Regency hotel had a smaller % of Indian food in the buffet. some people checking in on the night I left were paying $500 and were complaining loudly and boorishly. my boss and I paid $300/night in peak tourist season. if you like to stick to traditional Western food, there's plenty of it."
1748,"my room was quite large with plenty of room around my king bed. when I called the front desk to complain, they sent up a space heater that worked fine. the concierge brought up several packages and helped me pack them. given my extra baggage, I was concerned that I might not be able to check in everything. if it was not for him, the Hyatt representative met me at the airport and walked me through the check-in process."
1749,"the staff met my requests just fine. I found my room a bit small, but comfortable and I slept well.reception is large, modern and light and the room is very comfortable."
1750,"reviewers haven't stayed at 5 star hotels internationally. the hotel is not within walking distance of shopping, but most foreigners would not want to walk in Delhi anyway. there is a camp of homeless living under tarps across the street, and cows roam the streets."
1751,"my wife and we stayed at the Hyatt Regency the night of July 31. we paid a bit over $200 for the room, and the hotel pick-up was efficient. breakfast and lunch in the coffee shop were very good. the staff were friendly and professional, allowing us to retrieve them from the lobby staff who found them and put them into the lost and found."
1752,"the rooms are very, very old. they have not updated in the basic components such as electrical plugs and the ac, let alone the furnishing. all this would be ok except that they are charging $200. not worth this at all all. i always stay at Hyatt's as the name usually guarantees 'a standard standard'."
1753,"for $300+ you would expect that you'd get the room you reserve (King, non-smoking). instead I got a smoking room and two twin beds pushed together."
1754,hotel manager told him what was going on in his hotel. he and his team took immediate action to ensure that the remainder of our evening in Delhi was as enkoyable as possible and that we would try this place again next time we visited. the manager genuinely seems to want to sort it out.
1755,"the hotel is quite close to the centre - the lobby feels like a train station. the staff were all very polite and helpful with all my queries and requests, but bags took long time to get to my room and then get loaded into the taxi on departure."
1756,"the buffet breakfast was included in my rate, and was a nice way to start the day. by day three, the waiters new I liked ketchup and tabasco and would have both waiting for me upon my arrival for breakfast. the rooms were small, but were clean and nicely appointed."
1757,"this hotel is a joke. out of date product in the mini-bar, rude staff, slow restaurants, expensive drinks, poor transportation, small rooms, ancient bathrooms and basic at that. Wouldn't advise even considering it!!"
1758,the hotel was a wonderful break in our travels and I would recommend it. recommend upgrading to the club level for the best experience!
1759,the service is worse than what you get in a 2 star hotel. Not worth the money.Staff in Delhi Hyatt are inefficient and extremely rude! they do not know how to treat their customers. they need to be fully trained to work at the front desk!
1760,"the staff were good, expect the driver (night) failed to turn up to pick up from the airport. the hotel has a day driver - quick and street smart- that helped. Near the tube/ metro. Draby place with no frills but reflects the price, you should not pay more than 1200 to 1500 rupees including all taxes."
1761,"everything it's ok. Room, bathroom, the staff. Good place and good people. they help you with a smile on their faces."
1762,"the airport pickup guy had to wait 2 hours for our late plane - no problem, he was there and we connected easily. the hotel is right within easy walking distance to shopping as well as to the (excellent) subway station. (subway costs 8 roepies one way)"
1763,stayed in a budget hotel called Indraprastha at Karol Bagh. the hotel is situated on Tank Road nestled between Ajmal Khan Road and Gurdwara Road. right next to it is the Bengal Sweet Center.
1764,"we arrived and checked in at the hotel late after a delicious meal at Bukhara. our first impression was it was dark (poorly lit) and looked old. the check-in staff were efficient and friendly. however, the rooms were damp, old and tired, and not particularly clean either. it is definitely not the usual standards expected from previous stays in Intercontinental hotels worldwide."
1765,"the rooms I chose were newly renovated room which was a smoking room. but it was really brand new &amp; so there was no smoke smell whatsoever. the facilities at the hotel are excellent. great pool, good restaurants and the spa/sauna/gym are good. I also have to highly rate the people in the business centre."
1766,I was told there are no other rooms available for room change. the corridors were full of smell and dust because of repair work. we were left without electricity for an hour and when only I went to reception they sent a person to repair it. I did not know that this discount are my priorty club points.Because of this I had to change the hotel and opt for Le Meridien Delhi.
1767,"check in was quick and efficent and was taken to our room. the breakfast spread was a mix of cultures, Indian, English, American etc etc, which kept all the family happy! internet access and printing was fairly cheap, and the staff were extremly helpful."
1768,"this is an average hotel, definitely not a 5 star. the rooms were ok, but the bath room was bad, needs renovation, the reviews stated."
1769,"Nice hotel, good service, four restaurant and night club, wonderful was the barber shop with head massage. relaxing relaxing was a great place to relax."
1770,it's never too full of non-Indian tourists which I always find encouraging. the locals often come to the restaurants to each which i see as a plus point. they are starting renovation process and are promising 'a much better hotel - I just hope it doesn't lose its Delhi charm'
1771,IC-Nehru Place is an excellent business hotel with a convenient location with easy access to domestic airport as well as to Noida. rooms are outdated with stained carpets but they make it up with good amenities and space.
1772,"the word 'InterContinental' conjures up images of luxury and service. despite an e-mail request, no airport transfer wasn't waiting for me at Nehru Place, the clerk simply blamed me, without actually looking into the matter. only after providing proof, they sort-of said they were sorry. the duty manager could reluctantly be persuaded to be core courteous."
1773,"I booked two rooms in this hotel at the end of June but didn't find hotel as per 5 Star Standard. we were upgraded to Club room category &amp; we got access to Lounge as well but really surprised we did not find Good brand drinks in Lounge.Anyways,I find this as average kind of hotel."
1774,"this is a magnificent hotel, right in the heart iof Delhi's CBD Connaught Place/Barakhamba road. rooms are elegantly decorated, refurbished, with transparent bathroom sections, cozy beds and business friendly gadgets."
1775,"I stayed this hotel for my business trip, rooms &amp; dinning given good atmosphere and feels like a home."
1776,"the staff are excellent, and breakfast is good. the a/c in Blooms Restaurant is set to maximum chill in the evening - and the noise of this travels through the structure from 8 to 7 p.m. 7/7."
1777,"good place warm welcome nice rooms,good food.healthy atmosphere.overall great place to stay if you dont know the place well."
1778,"staff is very hospitable, good food and very comfortable rooms. guests are provided with a range of dining options, serving delicious east and spicy Indian as well as Chinese delicacies."
1779,"it was not only a matter of happiness but also pride infront of the foreigners, to have kept them and getting them to give us business."
1780,very good business hotel at the heart of the new Delhi city. ciaoronak hotel is a great hotel in the city of london. it is very close to the nidir city and the best city centre. very nice hotel with excellent staff and friendly staff.
1781,"good value for money if your business is in the Nehru Place of South Delhi area. a good hotel, good price for the money."
1782,"in a city where you can pay extortionate prices for the pretty grim here at least is an reliable - indeed, at times, luxurious way of spending. public parts particularly well appointed and the food in the restaurant delicious."
1783,"I did my booking with one of Travel Agent for this hotel.Hotel Lobby is good,Restaurants are good.But Rooms are not so good - but breakfast was too good with lots of items.even I didn't like the services of hotel."
1784,"the hotel entrance is grand, has all the facilities of a 5 star, rooms have pool views, very quiet, lovely food in the buffet restaurant. ideal for the airport, nearly 30 minutes drive. Definately stay when I visit Delhi again."
1785,the property is a typical city hotel - large and impersonal (which is good when you are on business!) the staff are very courteous and the rooms are spic and span. they are one of the few hotels which provide toileteries including shaving kit and toothbrush and toothpaste.
1786,"the worst experience ever had in india, the hotel staff member are least bothered abt there guest.wld never recommend to visit itz a horrible experience."
1787,Intercontinental Eros is in the city center and has a very convenient locaiton. rooms are spacious and elegantly laid out.
1788,"a brilliant hotel, I always stay here when I am in Delhi. in the middle of the city, affordable price and great food..."
1789,"the hotel is nice. rooms are comfortable and the dinings options are good. the room can do with some renovation - although it was clean and well maintaned, it wasn't the typical contemporary room that one has come to expect from 5-star hotels located in metros."
1790,2 Hr complimentary internet internet is a great place to stay. great rooms and discounted rates...what else would you want..... 2 hr free internet : great prices and affordable rates - great deals and cheap rates.
1791,the hotel is tired inside and out and in a second class location. the club lounge was well below my expectation and the rooms are old-fashioned. there are much better Delhi hotels including the Lalit which was Intercontinental until recently!!
1792,the hotel is reminicent of a run-down westworld from the Yul Brynner 1973 film. the view out the huge windows bypasses the built up commercial areas and looks onto green patch of Delhi.
1793,the breakfast buffet served food of the highest quality featuring local and international cuisine. the gym was busy in the morning with serious health buffs so that tells you the equipment is good.there's a market across the street in which everything from electronics to used clothes are sold.
1794,"the hotel is located in the south-east of the city, about 25 minute drive from the centre. taxis are very cheap, however if you want a bit of luxury, it offers reasonable prices for half day and full day rates for their cars and drivers, which are the Honda City, the Toyota Camry or the Audi A4."
1795,"stayed in two club rooms which were extremely comfortable. the club room included comforter, a spacious bathroom and top of the line bathroom amenities. we also had access to the Club Lounge which was the best Club lounge I have been to in India. our experience with the concierge who went out of his way to help us with future travel plans to Agra."
1796,"the hotel is stuck in time 15 years ago in more ways than one. the carpets smell musty, the decor is jaded and the staff seems bored and even the supposed traditional Indian welcome seems contrived...the breakfast is the standard buffet you can expect in such a hotel. no surprises or shocks. Yes the location is very convenient to check out Delhi."
1797,"we were there 3 days/2 nights found it to be a great place to sleep, eat, meet, work and relax. it was also very easy to operate from, to get in and out of, for getting to the places we wanted to go to."
1798,"great hotel, great facilities there, allways ready to help, less time consuming services and great food. great hotels, excellent facilities, good food and excellent food. a great location, saver - great breakfast and good breakfast."
1799,"the 24-hour fitness facility is well equipped with treadmills, ellipticals and stairmasters. the hotel does offer a driver service for pick-up and drop-off at the airport for about Rs.2,200."
1800,the intercontinental is the hotel chain to stay at in india. the service is impeccable at this hotel. The second you walk in someone holds the door for you and you are served some fresh guava juice.
1801,i like the services of this hotel coz we have already operated one chartered plain Qantas of 220 peoples. thanks to CHEERSPrince9899000220 - the hotel was good from front office bell desk to sales person...thanks to the cheersprince 98989990001202 saa tssy!
1802,"the bathroom a little tired with cracked plastic bath and loose electric switch hanging from the wall. good service, friendly but not imposing staff, room high standard but room low standard."
1803,"this hotel is absolutely fabulous...Very Grand and the service is brilliant. the moment you walk into the hotel, you are transferred into a frenzy of senses, smell, sound, sight - all very authentic and indian, beutiful insence etc etc...you cannot go wrong with this Hotel, though it is far out from the city!"
1804,"staff are the best i have ever experienced. nothing was too much trouble. rooms were clean and functional, flat screen TV, desk, refrigerator. internet connection was expensive (200Rps per hour)."
1805,we have just returned from two over night stays at this hotel. staff very good- competent and charming. food at breakfast and in Indian restaurant good. Rooms quite spacious and clean.
1806,this hotel was the friendliest and best appointed hotel of our trip. the evening buffet was super - especially the chef's made to order dosa!
1807,we arrived into Delhi for a couple of days relaxation before our tour of Northern India &amp; Tiger Safari. we stayed again at the end of the tour just to wind down before the return home to the UK.
1808,"this hotel was booked for us by a travel agent. the hotel is beauitful and the rooms are excellent, exactly what you would expect from 5 star hotel."
1809,"the hotel is very clean and modern and the pool area is large and pleasant. I did not come across any construction or renovation at the Intercontinental hotel. the staff is professional and adequate. The hotel had a couple restaurants with various chinese, indian and international selections."
1810,"very clean hotel with lots of marble and modern design. Small shopping centre nearby. Mostly Indian food with small choice of international dishes.We stayed for 2 nights which was about right., not a hotel for longer stays."
1811,"Nice Hotel but in a single room you never sleep along, as hotel is being restructured, mice run around rooms, good luck."
1812,"stayed at this hotel for a total of 3 hours and couldn't stand it anymore. they charged Inr12,000 plus 1,625 luxury tax and the internet was 800 + 100 VAT + service tax 99 so the total bill inr14,623 or US$365 for three hours."
1813,"Hong Kong hotel is 20 out of 10, this one is 0. room is so old and tired no life in it carpet carpet had stains on itbed is sagging no shower in the bathroom, have to stand in shower which has paint peeling off then at night when the next room flush the toilet it wake you up. will next time go back to another hotel again if you stay in a new hotel - it's the best place to stay!"
1814,"the buffet on Sundays is fantastic. there are several parts to it with salads, hot food, desserts and cheeses.there is always a chocolate fountain on the dessert table which is delicious."
1815,"my credit card had been charged TWICE for my stay. I settled my bill in full when I left, and that charge was on my statement, dated a few days later. the hotel double-charged me."
1816,the hotel is so beautiful and sparkling clean with fantastic service and food. it is just the management and front desk personnel that are a problem in this hotel. the service in the restaurants and the room attendants is fantastic.
1817,"my wife and I stayed a couple nights at the Intercontinental Nehru Place. the hotel is not cheap (around $230 after taxes), but it's nice, quiet and comfortable for our guests to stay in the midst of an expensive trip in Rajasthan. Delhi is expensive, and hotels are often poor value."
1818,"we lost about 20minutes to find the phone calls, and they charge me some calls not completed. i hope next time stay in other place more thurst."
1819,India is expensive currently as there is a shortage of good quality hotel rooms. this hotel costs similar amount to some much poorer properties in New Delhi perhaps 20% more but worth the investment investment.
1820,"a smoking room in this hotel was cleaned quite well. the staff found the room and brought it to me and showed me how to wrap the sari! the food from the “coffee shop” was outstanding. I ate almost all Indian food and it was great, plus the service was excellent."
1821,"superb staff, clean and efficient, great restaurants. Not quite so central but you always use taxi anyway and it is a price worth paying for this real quality."
1822,"I was knocked out by the service standards of the first hotel I stayed in. they have this system where you dial &quot;9' for any requests, this links them to their 'Instant Help Center'"
1823,"stay at this property twice, and had a fabulous stay both times. on our first stay, we arived after midnight, yet it seemed that the entire staff came out to greet us in an receiving line. the suite was immaculate and rollaway beds were made up for the children. both bathrooms were supplied with every imaginable amenity."
1824,"the front desk at this hotel is terrible. they don't know what they are doing. I booked thru Orbitz and my reservation was fully paid for before I arrived. i even brought the receipts with me when I went to check out, they told them to call orbitz, and they insisted on taking my credit card."
1825,"this hotel is beautiful and opulent, as you would expect of a hotel of this price range and class. the rooms are lovely, furnished well and with super bathroom (see uploaded photos). my parent’s room smelled of smoke but they were given an non-smoking room when they asked to change so no problem there."
1826,"we stayed at this hotel on the last leg of the package, which was our next-to-last night in India. the hotel made up for the hassles and substandard facilities that I had to endure prior to checking into the IC. it's a nice business-class hotel, and I thought it was tourist-friendly as well, although most other guests there were on business."
1827,I stayed at intercontinetal in december 2006. I will definitely stay here on my next visit to delhi.Only drawback is distance from the international airport which is about 45-60 minutes drive.
1828,"our trip to agra was fantastic - our tour company collected us from the hotel and physically put us in our first class train seats. the business centre is very good, but they do charge you for internet use. it was not very expensive. we would definately stay here again."
1829,"a helpful airport employee called the Hotel &amp; put us in touch with the front desk. the hotel stated that they didn't have any flight or arrival information so could not send an car. we waited another 30 minutes for another driver to pick us up, and of course were charged for it."
1830,"was in Delhi for an extended time over the summer and decided to splurge for a weekend. the wrong set of keys were sent up and when the right set came they got stuck in the door for some time. staff are desperately in need of some training. finally, got it open after 15 minutes waiting outside our room."
1831,"this year due to sheer convenience I once again stayed at this hotel. the hotel's standard services are still the same one expects from every 5 star hotel, but it was the little things they did that made time there so great. i tried their chinese restaurant this time...I was thrilled by the authentic cuisine put together by an actual chef from East Asia."
1832,"the front desk staff need a better attitude to customer service and to actually do what they say they will do. the rooms are good, and clean: I've stayed in both the Club rooms and one of the Suites."
1833,the manager at the reception with red tie offered me a complimentary juice and welcomed me back home. the staff were nice and the rooms were old but well maintained - there is noice travelling from outside if you want to eat in the car or go to the taxii. i was really tired and wanted to keep away from normal formality.
1834,"stayed for 3 days. Room service excellent. some reception staff very cool,some get very stressed. one person didnt have a clue and treated us. 24 hour restaurant -you can still see flies allover. music too loud for conversation."
1835,"we had 2 rooms for 3 days during an off-peak season. our price was quite good (6580 Rupees plus tax) but in the heat of summer, you'd expect a top hotel to apologize profusely, refund your room or offer another room, or something similar. the thermostats and climate control systems were old, but most of the hotel facilities had been updated."
1836,"warm and cozy rooms, plush interiors, nice service and tasty food. good connectivity for business and tour planner available in the hotel. a good breakfast and good value for the price paid."
1837,we were made very welcome and nothing was too much trouble. the hotel is very plush and elegant it still had that comfy feeling. a lovely hotel - the staff was very nice and cosy.
1838,the hotel is designed with class and ambience. Had meals in quite a few of the restaurants and all of them were superb. even tried the Bill Clinton meal in one! it's pretty big and can keep 3 people happily fed!
1839,"the hotel was so cramp it was the worst room out of all the other hotels we stayed in. the dublin bar was ok but didnt offer us a apology, it is the last night of our holiday and worst. i cant understand why we were thererecommended to stay looking back on the holiday."
1840,"the only place u can eat good food 24/7. the hotel is one of the nicest hotels in the city. great partys, lots of young people, and the perfect place to ate good foods 24/7."
1841,the hotel security appears to be high because of other events in the country. the only downside is the large number of AA and Finnair flight crews do monopolize the business center computers periodically during the day. i plan on staying at the ITC Maurya in New Delhi.
1842,"my father and I stayed at the Maurya when in india last month. the hotel has a deluxe room with twin beds, but with separate duvets, it wasn't the problem. i ate several meals at this hotel, and the Bukhara is an old tradition of mine and yes, while it may be sometimes erratic in quality, I still love it. my standard order is the leg of lamb, daal and naan."
1843,"i stayed at this hotel, booked from the internet, all though december is high season. the rooms are large and comes with all mod cons of five star hotel."
1844,"the most famous resutrant in this hotel is bukhara and dal bhukara is the delicacy. the other side is a beautiful swimming pool, which i feel is not good enuf to swim but to just lie and soother your nerves)"
1845,"hotel rooms are very well decorated, very clean and trendy. food at the main restaurant was really outstanding. staff was great with little delays for the check out. the hotel is an excellent place to stay in DELHI."
1846,"every 5* hotel in india is amazing. food and bars very good and very entertaining. well worth a visit. if they didn't have something that you wanted, they would get it for you."
1847,"wake up call automated service didn't work properly. hotelkeeping department should be focused on small things, placed in room, not to be missed. there should've been discrepance on ameneties in separete rooms.-they advertise Executive lounge but one is not in funcion."
1848,this 5 star hotel is located in the green diplomatic enclave. the hotel has most features you would expect like a swimming pool and spa and has numerous top notch restaurants. however you can't go wrong by staying here.
1849,"stayed here for 5 nights in July for business in a quite part of the town (Diplomatic Enclave)+ Large, clean rooms with good amenities. great restaurant selection and food, although expensive (especially the alcohol)"
1850,I stayed at the Maurya Sheraton in 1984. it was beautiful and one could really experience Indian culture. I took a cab in every day to be with friends in Vijay Nagar. the whole trip was an exotic paradise.
1851,this was the same hotel Bill Clinton chose to stay during his visit to India. it is surrounded by one of the greenest places in Delhi.
1852,the rooms were spacious and very clean. the hotel is a little way from the sights - short cab ride its well worth to sometimes escape and be in an relaxing environment..
1853,the best is the indian food restaurant- bukhara. overall food is exceptional in the hotel. a great property is well located. good location is close to the iia - st t..
1854,"the stay was very good overall, but restaurants in the hotel are quite expensive. on my arrival day, I needed cash for the day after and reception send their car to take me to nearest ATM."
1855,"the room's warm colors give you a sense of peace and comfort, especially at the end of an arduous day2. each room has its own mini-bar - stocked with the best alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks3.The swimming pool was large and very well maintained4. There was rich variety in food."
1856,the hospitality is great - you are in a special world right from the time that the doorman greets you. the rooms are lovely and the offers like the trip to the Taj Mahal are really well thought-through. I love the shopping arena in the hotel which is open at unearthly hours for the last-minute shopper.
1857,the food in the chinese was exp and ok. the room was big but didn't care much for it. Wouldn’t return.
1858,one of good hotels in New-Delhi.Excellent location.Nearby to India Gate. located near to all Embassies.
1859,"the ITC Maurya has all the facilities (gym, pool, spa) that you will need to feel comfortable. the hotel taxis will try to tout you and ask you if they can stay and wait for you at your destination. sometimes it's cheaper to walk onto the street and grab and auto rickshaw."
1860,"it is a very good hotel to stay with I liked it as its half way from airport and the CP. the hotel has very modern looks of rooms, the staff is very prompt, and every minute details is taken care off when you stay at them."
1861,the modern looks make it truly on par with any other 5 star hotel room across the world. the food is expensive but they do have good room service.
1862,"this is one of the most happening hotels in India, Speedy, efficient service. excellent location in the Diplomatic Enclave. a great coffee shop. nice location."
1863,the hotel ambience is fantastic. the room was good and the breakfast buffett was great. it was an overnight stay for me and I really liked everything about the hospitality which it provided.
1864,the experience at Maurya was bad to say the least.It looked like a cheap hotel which hasn't been maintained for ages.
1865,Hotel Mourya is crown of historic city of Delhi. during business stay they provide all luxury and comforts which really miss in other place. good food and warmth service are the tool which fetch you again and again in hotel Mouya..
1866,the BEST HOSPITALITY never found anywhere else in the world. it is one of the best hotels in Delhi with positive vibes and always look lively.
1867,the best part of my stay at ITC was that they never let me feel that i was away from my home and looked after my comforts. I was so happy to stay with the staff and their staff was a pleasure..
1868,"Maurya hosts one of india's first discotheques. service is speedy, efficient &amp; courteous. food at all the restaurants is great.- my Humble House is extremely quaint and dainty. Terrific coffee at the bar. great location.."
1869,"hotel staff were always professional and helpful, without being obseqious and hungry for tips as they are in some Delhi hotels. I would definitely come back to the Maurya as I got a very good rate."
1870,"i stayed in couple of excellent hotels in &amp; out of India. but when you enter the huge central Pavilion from front porch, you can't stop looking at bright lighting and gold finish elevator doors.Once inside your room, your dream walk to luxury continues with sparking clean interiors, 32 inches LCD TV, cozy bed, and variety of fruits, snacks available at your disposable."
1871,it was offical conference organised by my organisation. it included introduction to PDMS etc. It was a full day conference with deligates from wide variety of industries.
1872,"the hotel was classy and the service was excellent. seems like ITC Maurya is 'the' hangout of celebrities and VVIPs in New Delhi. the only disappointed was an extra bed that we had asked for, which collapsed in the middle of the night while we were sleeping."
1873,I chose my usual 500 Starpoints welcome amenity which helps build up my points for future redemptions. check-in is always in the same style as other Starwood properties where staff greet their guests with warmth and in style that reflects all starwood Hotels.
1874,"my husband has stayed at the Maurya Sheraton more than 25 times. the architecture, Interiors and Rooms are beautifully designed and the hotel is meant for the creme de la crème, but the mural dome in the lobby witnesses hundreds of business meetings,people who just come here to have a meeting and then move on!"
1875,"the Maurya Sheraton excels in fulfilling this perquisite by a mile. every member of the staff is helpful, kind, compassionate &amp; cheerful. they go out of their way to make you feel welcome and comfortable."
1876,the food tastes so delicious here at this restaurant that people should be careful not to eat their own fingers!!. this is what I call dining in style... it's an awesome Mughal Experience...!
1877,"we spent 3 nights there while on a wedding ceremony in Delhi &amp; Kathmandu. staff is professional and very keen to help you. many nice details, i.e. room staff can see from outside if room is occupied, there is european plug on the desk, no need for adapters! food is excellent, though we only had breakfast from the huge buffet and one dinner - all other nighs we were out of the hotel."
1878,"excellent, Fabulous and Magnificent.. Amazing food in Bukhara restaurant. it is one of the poshest restaurant of new Delhi - a restaurant in the city of san francisco. most foreign country ministries stay there during their visit to India. hotel is landmark of luxury."
1879,the service is impeccable and totally reliable - pleasant and courteous staff go out of their way to make your stay a memorable one. the hotel does not overcharge for items such as the internet or the laundry (compared to other 5+ star hotels around the world).
1880,it is one of the most comforting hotes with nice rooms and excellent food. it always nice to come and visit the hotel.
1881,"check-in process delayed my schedule by nearly an hour. hotel also houses the famed Bukhara and Dum Pukt restaraunts, the best known in india."
1882,"maurya's d best hotel Ive visisted so far. the ambience was awesome, the food sumptuous..services were prompt."
1883,"the hotel has hosted some of the world famous dignitarties including Bill Clinton. the massage chair, the jacuzzi tub in the bathroom and the music system are my favourites and I would recommend the ITC One rooms as they are an experience in themselves.I also enjoyed the food at Bukhara and entertaining a few clients there for business has provded helpful."
1884,"the Bhukara is the best in india. good loyalty program, the welcomaward. Happy hours at the Towers lounge is worth mentioning as excellent. personalised services. excellent food is of the highest qualtiy."
1885,hotel upgraded me - I was glad. the upgraded room was wonderful. I particularly liked the massage chair in the room and the music system. i like the hotel's relative closeness to the airport.Would definitely recommend this for your next Delhi visit.
1886,this hotel property is a great place to go to with friends or business guests for the food at Buhkara. recommend the stay to anyone who wants to be close to the great food in Mauyra.
1887,the hotel is located near the posh diplomatic area of New Delhi and hence is in relatively verdant and peaceful surroundings. a good workout before or after meal at one of these places is recommended.
1888,the front office staff were extremely courtious &amp; their 'namaste' welcome with their smiles takes out all your stress.
1889,all five star hotels in india are majestic and oversized. the main area of the hotel is a great place to stay in the iTC tower. all 5 star hotel in India are luxurious and majestic - this is no exception. only drawback is constant problems with internet access.Bhukara and Dhum Pukt are v. expensive but excellent restaurants. Bfast is average.
1890,"stayed in the Murya for several reasons. the hotel is a good hotel mainly because of its level of service. it also hosts many conferences, seminars as well as receives dignities from around the world."
1891,"stayed here one night for business in the Towers section of the hotel. enjoyed the Dublin Bar happy hour with co-workers from 6-8 PM - they kept on serving free onion rings, chicken fingers, nuts and even a &quot;Clinton's special'"
1892,"the rooms at this hotel were great. I had booked 2 rooms but when I arrived at the hotel, only 1 of them was ready. most of the staff were salivating for tips. they greet you hypocritically hoping that you'll drop a tip in their direction. i think it would be better to stay in the Sheraton in Saket which is cheaper as well as newer."
1893,"stayed in towers room which was a little small but the quality of the room and elec toys made up for it. massive flat screen tv. great hotel overall, good choice of restaurants, make sure you visit the Bukhara Restaurant, amazing food."
1894,"the hotel had some visiting dignitary and made your arrival seem like it was an inconvenience. after requesting a &quot;non-smoking room, I returned back down to the reception and finally I was put in an unused gym room."
1895,hotel looks spectacular and seems to be a favourite of Delhi's rich and famous. staff very friendly and efficient. Afterwards I can recommend the laundry service that makes your shirt look better than new!
1896,stayed at the Executive Level in a newly renovated room. good size room with stable internet connection. Nice bathroom with glass separation to the bedroom.Very nice touch by room assistant who added personal touch to housekeeping.
1897,"the hotel is the preferred residence of visiting heads of state and global business leaders for over 25 years&quot;, it should be better. the towers Club staff are great, as are the poolside staff; the renovated rooms are a great improvement, especially as the windows now fit..."
1898,the hotel is not an easy walk from any shops or restaurants. it is a superb hotel although expensive by any country's standards.
1899,stayed for 1 night in the hotel for a recent business trip. was booked in deluxe suite paying hefty USD630 per night - the most expensive hotel I have stayed in.
1900,"stayed at this hotel for two nights at the beginning of March. the room was clean, the bed was very comfortable with supersoft pillows (my description, guests can choose from a choice of different pillows if they wish)."
1901,I went to new Delhi on a business trip and enjoyed my time at the Maurya. I sat in the lobby waiting on an associate and really enjoyed the live piano player and his'show tunes'
1902,the hotel staff was very nice and were very eagar to help. it's one of the nicest hotels in India and it doesn't compare to a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons but it is isolated in the diplomatic enclave and you need an driver to take you around.
1903,I stayed in the main Maurya hotel from 1/13 to 1/22/08. I had booked the room on the internet and checked in was very smooth. room was turned over twice a day. bathroom/showers and closet areas were excellent. breakfast buffet was included in price [$450]
1904,the Starwoods in India make a Platinum guest feel appreciated. the hotel features two restaurants featured in the Thousand Things to Do Before You Die book. we tried Dum Puhkt and it was great but we were so sleepy we may not have fully appreciated it.
1905,"we did go back for dinner at Bukhara, and it was one of the best Indian meals we have ever had anywhere in the world. the rooms were nicely decked out but a little small."
1906,the lobby is very nice.Executive rooms were very good (not very big though).Main restaurant is nice place to have lunch or dinner.Even the bar/pub was nice and happened to be a very popular place for the local youngsters.
1907,we stayed here twice each for one night during out stay in india. we frequented both bars in the hotel and the Irish themed bar was dark and dingy but surprisingly appeared to be the more exclusive of the two bars. the best part about this hotel however is the Bukhara tandoori restaurant.
1908,"our room was called a Garden View Deluxe suite and was the size of two hotel rooms. the hotel was clean, luxurious, and hospitable. rooms were modern (flat screen Plasma TVs), luxurious bedding, fantastic air conditioning, & free from any odors even though smoking is common in hotels in india. some of our colleagues at the conference stayed at Taj Palace and the Taj Mahal Mansingh."
1909,"this was definitely one of the best rooms we had in India. the buffet is also very good. a great experience here. great, updated room with great bathroom."
1910,"the restaurant is surviving on business travellers with nowhere else to go. their terrible service, average food and expensive prices would make sure they close down fast!"
1911,"reviewers have emphasized that the hotel seems to be overpriced. however, despite the prices, I had no complaints with the hotels. the room was clean with a very comfortable bed, service was acceptable, and breakfast buffet was serviceable."
1912,a flat panel TV (37 in?) and several English cable channels were available. breakfast buffet (included with room) is really good. great selection (Indian and Western)
1913,"the room rate was nearly $500/night and, in my opinion, quite overpriced. I have stayed in hotels in Europe, the united states, and other parts of the world at the same room rates where the hotels were much more luxurious."
1914,we chose Meriden for our first night and then Sheraton for the 2 separate stays we planned during our golden triangle tour. we were travelling back from Amritsar on a late train and phoned the hotel to arrange pick-up at the train station. he speedily packed all 4 suitcases in the car and got us there in quick time.
1915,"stayed on the refurbed 4 th floor - the Bakhara restaurant is in top 35 restaurants in the world. the tandoor lamb is fantastic! great room, nice environment, staff very helpful! would go back!"
1916,"the staff at the Maurya Sheraton were so helpful to us in our little crisis. they went so above and beyond for us, advising us on the steps necessary to get our act together - -1st, going to the US Embassy, and then the Indian Tourism Bureau...and made it onto our flight with our emergency 1-year passport and the exit visa stamp. we spent quite a while lounging around the lobby and it was very pretty with murals that remind me of Orozco or Diego Rivera in"
1917,the hotel is close to the airport and not more than 15 minutes by auto rickshaw from the center of town and the railway station (convenient if you're taking a day trip to Agra)
1918,"i was on business w/ friend; he has very expensive tastes. but my 1 night was $500. ouch. great room, nice interior, outside is sort of ugly, but who cares.Free breakfast (omlette...maybe best ich've ever had)Only complaint is the $15 internet fee; miserly when you pay that much to get nickle and dimed."
1919,I booked this hotel on their website and stayed for 8 days in Jan. 07. the booking process was not without glitches. I had booked the hotel at the last moment(big mistake) and had no choice because of the lack of availability of more moderately priced hotels.
1920,"the hotel has three separate divisions, the regular rooms, Tower rooms and the ITC One rooms. the staff was wonderful and went out of their way to make us feel like royalty."
1921,stay at this hotel for the 3rd time this year due to a conference at the hotel. it's difficult to work out for long time as there is almost no air conditioning in the gym.
1922,"the hotel is really three connected hotels - the Executive Tower, the Club Tower and the ITC One Club. rooms in the executive tower are very small, and were noisy during my last visit due to construction."
1923,"this hotel was excellent in some areas and unsatisfactory in others. the hotel staff will cater to your every need. most of the staff you will encounter speak English and are very polite. Supposed to stop at 7pm, but that's not true."
1924,"in the winter of 2005-6, my wife and I stayed at the Maurya Sheraton on 3 separate occasions. the club was a bit cheaper ($275.00US) and we were lucky to get the newly renovated 12th floor."
1925,this was my first trip to India and my 4 night stay was a very good experience. the purpose of the trip was business and the desk and chair in the relatively spacious room on the third floor had good reception for the wireless internet connection.
1926,"if the Maurya qualifies as 5 star, I would give this place close to a 4 star (3.5 would probably fit the bill perfectly). the hotel's location is very central, with hardwood floors, plasma TVs, and marble bathrooms. -great bakery. lots of U.S. style cakes and pastries, but reasonably priced (also 1/2 price after 8pm)."
1927,the hotel's proximity to the Connaught Place by 3kms has made it a preferred stay option for both leisure and business travellers.
1928,"amazing is the word.. wonderful hotel, wonderful ambience and wonderful staff. what a place..a treat for everybody!. marvellous hotel and great staff!"
1929,"hotel Siddharth is one of Comfortable Hotels. the hotel has almost all the required facilities like Swimming Pool, Doctor On call and the most thing i liked about it is the comfortability and quality of food and ofcourse the service they provide is very quick."
1930,"we were travelling with a tour party and had read reviews. the foyer was modern and welcoming, reception was efficient and our room on the second floor was clean and comfortable. staff were helpful and efficient. location of the hotel is never going to win prizes but was fairly close to the sights of New and Old Delhi. outside swimming pool closed for major refurbishment, just as well as the weather was unseasonably cold."
1931,"this is my first time in India and we went to walk the Gift Show. our travel agent tried to book several mid-priced hotels for us for $300 USD per night, which is still quite high for what we thought we would have to pay for a mid hotel in india. the hotel was clean and I had no problems using the towels or sleeping in the bed."
1932,the first room they put us in really had a strong stench from smoking. the second room was better and we were pretty tired so we just put up with it. we then discovered that the fridge didn't work and the kettle did not work.
1933,the city park hotel is under renovation and you had to access the elevator from the next level (not fun with suit cases). the air condition did not work all of the time throughout the entire building. the hotel was doing construction on the patio until 8pm.
1934,"some rooms are still not renovated, look like 15-20 years old, but it doesn't mean that they charge you less if they put you in such a room...the aircondition seems to be an absolute must, only arctic temperatures seem acceptable for their guests."
1935,I was firstly given a room with an interconnecting door. you can hear your neighbours nocturnal noises etc. Had to sleep one night and then we were given the room on the fifth floor after complaining. even more disgusting...bathrooms were dirty...fixtures on wall were old and dusty. by no standards it can be called 4 star! for the price they charge it is definitely not worth it. I hope readers of this review will never stay in any of the Jaypee hotels as the
1936,"the room we had was refurbished and extremely nice with flat screen tv and waterfall shower. the view out the window was terrible - construction. no double beds were available. our friends tried to get some, but were moved back the next night. be warned about the construction! it begins at about 8am and proceeds to about 9pm."
1937,a man occupying the desk at the hotel is useless and rude. he showed such indifference to my query that it was unbelievable. his bedroom was fine - comfortable and clean. I noted no smells anywhere. Better/double glazed windows might be good to keep out the noise from the street below.
1938,"you can stay at a much nicer hotel for the price they charge. the smell, are small, and the staff is rude. there was construction going on when i stayed. hotel also gave us trouble about the complementary taxi to the airport. Would definately not suggest."
1939,we stayed at this hotel for one night passing through Delhi on the way to Agra. room service and housekeeping staff were extremely pleasant but refused to leave the room until they were tipped (every time) a sign outside states that refurbishments are in progress so perhaps this is to be improved so maybe this will be better. there are plenty of cheaper hotels that offer same standard of accommodation..and without the smell!
1940,some of the staff who work on reception are unbelievably arrogant &amp; rude. a shame as the rest of staff appear conscientious.
1941,location isn't brilliant as there is little to visit within walking distance. Connaught place/Old Delhi are about 20 - 30 minutes by taxi. would stay there again.
1942,we stayed one night only at this hotel as it was closer to the airport. we were greeted by a charming girl...but once she was gone there was not one friendly face except perhaps in the business centre. after all our wonderful memories in India...this one wasn't awful....just ordinary!! We had definitely been spoilt with our other choices.
1943,the staff at the counter looks ok but do not help when accosted with a problem. realised that hotel is discriminatory quite late.
1944,the service needs to improve a bit though.Had stayed at The Grand in the same area but remained away as heard it had caught fire some time back.
1945,the hotel was close to the airport and was clean and had a plush entrance. there were no other hotels close by as these were mainly in the diplomatic area which was near the town centre. this becomes of major concern once you realise how bad the traffic can be at certain times of the day and you're in hurry to get to airport.
1946,"I stayed on 9th and 10th June 2009. the hotel tariff is reasonable and have all facilities Viz. secretarial services, conference facilities and health club. The hotel is nearer to airport and is veery close to my meeting place i.e. Indian Roads Congress. I enjoy staying in this hotel. this is 12th time I's staying. it is the best place to stay in the world."
1947,"we had two day business meeting in the hotel Vasant Continental. hotel is non smoking zone, the space alloted for smokers was open &amp; very hot, i personally think its good way to discourage smoking but it would be good if hotel provides a little comfortable space for smoking as few members were annoyed by the heat. the swimming pool is very small so gets crowded in morning hours so couldn't really enjoy it."
1948,Ambience PerfectFood : a must try for chicken dishes. spaciousEnvironment is just so perfect for staying and especially when you are stressed down with work.
1949,stayed in this hotel while on business travel to delhi. the rooms are fantastic. i enjoyed the stay.Rooms are excellent. service is proffessional and staff is courteious. buffet breakfast is the only area that may be improved was the menu of Buffet breakfast.
1950,"I have stayed here for more than 5 times... and ambience here absolutely great... during IPL season - I i was staying along with Deccan chargers team and we could meet Gilchrist, Laxman, Gibbs etc...it was a wonderful evening...Suite room with complimentry wine will give pleasant sleep after tiresome business hours...Review by JP # 9W 111061985."
1951,stayed at Jaypee Vasant Delhi when on a Page &amp; Moy Tour during Oct 08.. hotel is some distance from the centre of new Delhi- (about 40 mins in Tuk TuK) but some would say that this is an advantage to be out of the hotel boundary.
1952,"the food quality is excellant and to my surprise the hotel has provided a complimentary wine bottle in my room. if I get an opportunity, I will not hesitate to Sign in once again."
1953,"my room was a good size compared to some of the hotels I have earlier stayed in. the staff was extremely warm and helpful and attentive. The best part is the restaurants (which I continue to visit), especially the Chinese and the cafe with quite an unusual name -Eggspectation.."
1954,"despite promising first impressions on entering the hotel, this hotel was very disappointing. several problems occurred during my stay. a hotel is undergoing refurbishment in some rooms and my room had strong smell of glue / solvents. however, that smell was preferrable to the one that met me on enter the bathroom."
1955,this hotel was selected for its peaceful ambience for a last evening in Delhi prior to flying out the following morning. the meal we had in the Restaurant ranked as one of the best of our trip. Authentically Indian. There are other restaurants in this building but this was the Best - check in was smooth and trouble free! we are not frequent users of 'City&quot; Hotels' and this more than met our expectations. Friendly without being fussy. Large but not soulless.Just what we needed for good nights sleep
1956,"a nice hotel. not exceptional but clean, comfortable, good service and reasonable price. better classified as 4 star rather than 5 star."
1957,"this hotel is billed as a 5*, but not an european 5 *. it's about 15 minutes from the main airport, be amazed by the changing route, dual carriage way leading down into an awful road through mad traffic and every kind of transport you can imagine! the rooms are decent size, with all the normal facilities, very comfortable bed."
1958,"the massage room is far too small and the masseur not up to his job. bath room was a delight, even though I booked the cheapest room!"
1959,"hotel Vasant Continental has a nice little gym, yoga classes, spa and salon. the breakfast buffet was delicious, they had both Western breakfast offerings, an omelette station, and South Indian breakfast as well, not to mention fresh fruit. I never tried the room service, as I like to be out exploring the city hot spots, but there was always plenty of bottled water, my sheets and towels were always clean and fresh."
1960,breakfast included in our stay which was provided with a bottle of wine and fruits when we first checked in! - there was an event at the hotel on fri night! hip hop night.
1961,this hotel is a bit away from the business quarter. rooms are adequate and service is what one would expect in an business-oriented hotel.
1962,"we stayed in Jaypee Vasant Continental just for a night in transit between international and domestic flight. hotel itself was clean and nice, room was also well maintained and room-service was prompt and food was of good quality."
1963,"hotel was pleasant surprise, as it was in a quiet area and had good food (though expensive) and newly refurbished and clean rooms. hotel is located near JNU campus and airport and around the corner is western style shopping area."
1964,"two computers is inadequate and the service should be included with the room rate at a hotel of this caliber. for women, check out the well priced beauty parlor."
1965,the hotel is very conviniently located at the middle circle on CP. the rooms are clean and the beds are soft &amp; comfortable. there are 2 issues (1) The room is small (2) One has to climb 2-3 flights of stairs to reach the room as its spread over 3 floors with no lift. insist for discount upto 20% of the tariff will be waived if you are not able to stay in the cc..
1966,"the hallways were clean, well lit; well decorated. the rooms were larger than the other hotel in the same area, in comparison, this seemed more deserving of the &quot;mid-range' or 2-3 star designation."
1967,"a chap is introduced to you as the travel desk. he can give free maps, free travel advice and 15mins free of internet service."
1968,"our room was clean and comfortable, but it was the only hotel we stayed at in Delhi so difficult to make a comparison. do not trust this hotel with any of your travel arrangements, or this travel agency."
1969,i paid about $80 for one night here in the Connaught location in November. it looked fine to me and was shown a room and told I could choose another if I wasn't happy with it. the bathroom was dirty and falling apart like I expected bathrooms in India to be (this was the first time it actually happened in an hotel though).
1970,"our girlfriend and we stayed at hotel Jukaso Inn (the one in Connaught Place) for our first night in India on 10/11/07. we booked the hotel online in a last minute rush because other than our plane tickets and initial waitlisted new Delhi-Jaisalmer train ticket, we had organised nothing for the holiday in india - we paid 3850Rs + tax for one double room!"
1971,"I booked at the WRONG Jukaso Inn after reading a favorable review in Frommers guide book. the hotel was really nothing special, nor terrible. just average. but it's possible that others who have reviewed this hotel might have been reviewing the wrong location?"
1972,"the hotel's interior visible through the glass lifts is adds to the excitement. the rooms are excellent, nicely done up, and the bell staff still gives you a taste of the legacy."
1973,"the breakfast there is complimentary.Room was a nice one with TV, comfertable bed with pillow, mood lighting and many more."
1974,"the hotel bar (Nero) was great, with a great humidified smoking room and very attentive staff. monsoon the Indian restaurant was pricy but worth it (the herb prawn starter was to die for)"
1975,I have stayed at this hotelabout 3 times in last 2 years and the serivce at hotel is always great.Location is great.the only thing I would say is that when I booked this time through AAA there was extra charge for breakfast rate and when reached hotel bkfst was complimentary.we enjoy our stay here everytime..
1976,"spent a quality time in delhi with my wife and I really like room hotel all environment,specially room service,publikas. spent time at hotel hotel in the u.s."
1977,Ranks on the higher end of Le Meridien's that I've stayed at. I was satisfied by my stay and the value and service.
1978,"stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in two different rooms. clean, modern hotel with good design throughout including'mood lighting&quot; in the rooms. staff were very helpful as you would hope/expect in a hotel of this class/price. only thing was we could not get the wi-fi to work so ended up using the expensive business centre to check email."
1979,the hotel was my favourite place in the city! Friendly staff. Very safety. we received a welcome drinks (coffee and tee) and welcome bindi.
1980,"I stayed here always when I visited New Delhi. the lobby is amazing; futuristic style.Room is great and spacious, beautiful bathroom.Exquisite.Very clean and well organized.Large flat screen tv in the room.Wi-fi available with charge.The concierge was very helpful.the hotel staff friendly.excellent breakfast.there are some shopping arcade in hotel. Try to visit Jaipur Gem Palace, they have nice collection of jewelry with reasonable price."
1981,"the hotel is currently under renovation, which means jackhammers and workmen throwing stuff out windows. the renovated room was decorated out in a cross between Ikea and Norwegian wood, with lots of sharp corners to bump into at night."
1982,"the hotel is located in the city centre area, but the room rate is surprisingly low, and staffs are nice. buffet dinner on the ground floor cafe cost you US$70 per person."
1983,"great hotel, very modern interior, spacious and airy. didnt appear to be many western visitors there. highly recommend all restaurants, particularly the chinese rest located on top floor. colonial decor but with great food and great view over delhi.down side would be lack of fast free internet acces, poor pool and sundeck area."
1984,it is one of the most classy elegant trendy trendy hotel i have ever seen during my business travel. the hotel is a beautiful clean stylish hotel where staff makes you feel at home if u alone. one imp thing internet is good. Would recommend business travelers definitely.
1985,the hotel did not send a limo to the airport because my PA didn't inform them. this differentiates the best from the better.#2: security check has been stepped up. i love this but to surrendder my swiss knife shows lack of discretion.
1986,"great service, great food, excellent rooms and a good location. checkins are always quick and the room is always just right."
1987,the staff are generally helpful and attentive (though note my comment later) it is a 5* hotel that caters well for business and leisure travellers.
1988,"the hotel is located in the center of the civic district, within walking distance of Connaught Place and short rides from the Beaux Arts buildings. the room I had was excellent--apparently recently renovated. room service was attentive and housekeeping was diligent. they provided complimentary water, which is very important for Delhi. too many pigeons and crow use it as a bird bath - and leave their stuff next to its rim."
1989,"there were four apples of the Red Delicious variety but the food I had was good and I was not tempted to snack. the reason is quite simple: poverty. The Indian who is serving you as waiter or driver has a monthly salary lower than the cost of your room. in India, it is 10%. this means that Indian worker is underpaid."
1990,the service was not what I would expect from a 5* hotel when paying room rates. the hotel is very centrally located and the contemporary design sets it apart from other hotels in Delhi. also the rooms are fairly spacious (but too dark!)
1991,this is less a hotel for tourists than for business travelers. the thermostats in the rest of the hotel worked properly and the airconditioning was so cold that my friends and I had to leave dinner to get jackets. i have never understood why Delhi hotels are able to charge what they do.
1992,"stayed two night here while temperatures were above 42C in the city. decor was superb with imported italian glass tiles everywhere. Rooms were in excellent shape, large, and beautifully done. tried all the restaurants and bars on the ground floor - Monsoon is one of the top indian restaurants in Delhi."
1993,the htoel staff were lovely and friendly and happy to help in anyway possible. they even had Tom and Jerry playing on the television screens on lift and lobby :)
1994,we conducted our Business get together for some of our esteemed clients and friends for getting our Master Card Certification. we enjoyed the hall and nice dinner buffet arrangement. Ambience was great. It was a wonderful evening.
1995,"the airport pick-up failed to arrive in spite of booking and a phone call to confirm. the check-in staff were arrogant and rude and in fact so were the majority of the staff in the hotel including lady duty manager who is rude, unhelpful. every member of staff wants to be tipped - quite why I do not know as they don't offer any form of service."
1996,this is a great hotel - amazing service. the restaurant on the top floor offers great views. The rooms are comfortable. it is located in the heart of the city of london.
1997,"was impressed by the design &amp; the bold statement the hotel makes. the service, courtesy was impeccable. just right for a business traveller."
1998,the breakfast included in package is very tasty. love to sit in coffee shop at 24 hrs to eat something or can have a sip of beer any time. india gate is just walking distance. lot of internal changes happened since my last visit.
1999,"this is my favorite biz hotel while in DelhiNewly renovated, big size rooms and bathrooms, good breakfast. it could do with little better housekeeping as i noticed insufficient cleanliness on my last stay."
2000,"nice location, actually able to get out and walk somewhere which is unusual for a 5* in India. Pool area disappointing though. Service etc first class service etc."
